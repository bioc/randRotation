Description: A collection of methods for performing random orthogonal transformations (random rotations) on high-dimensional data (e.g. microarray or RNA-seq data) with batch structure.
    The random rotation approach allows exact testing of dependent test statistics with linear models following arbitrary (particularly non-linear) batch effect correction methods.
    The package further provides methods for estimating the local degrees of freedom (consumption) of idempotent (or approximately idempotent) data mappings.
