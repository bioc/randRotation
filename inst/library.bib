abstract = {Real time PCR (quantitative PCR, qPCR) is now a well-established method for the detection, quantification and typing of different microbial agents in the areas of clinical and veterinary diagnostics and food safety. Although the concept of PCR is relatively simple, there are specific issues in qPCR that developers and users of this technology must bear in mind. These include the use of correct terminology and definitions, understanding of the principle of PCR, difficulties with interpretation and presentation of data, the limitations of qPCR in different areas of microbial diagnostics and parameters important for the description of qPCR performance. It is not our intention in this review to describe every single aspect of qPCR design, optimization and validation; however, it is our hope that this basic guide will help to orient beginners and users of qPCR in the use of this powerful technique.},

@book{Efron2012,
abstract = {We live in a new age for statistical inference, where modern scientific technology such as microarrays and fMRI machines routinely produce thousands and sometimes millions of parallel data sets, each with its own estimation or testing problem. Doing thousands of problems at once is more than repeated application of classical methods. Taking an empirical Bayes approach, Bradley Efron, inventor of the bootstrap, shows how information accrues across problems in a way that combines Bayesian and frequentist ideas. Estimation, testing, and prediction blend in this framework, producing opportunities for new methodologies of increased power. New difficulties also arise, easily leading to flawed inferences. This book takes a careful look at both the promise and pitfalls of large-scale statistical inference, with particular attention to false discovery rates, the most successful of the new statistical techniques. Emphasis is on the inferential ideas underlying technical developments, illustrated using a large number of real examples.},

@article{Tabb2007,
abstract = {Shotgun proteomics experiments are dependent upon database search engines to identify peptides from tandem mass spectra. Many of these algorithms score potential identifications by evaluating the number of fragment ions matched between each peptide sequence and an observed spectrum. These systems, however, generally do not distinguish between matching an intense peak and matching a minor peak. We have developed a statistical model to score peptide matches that is based upon the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. This scorer, part of the " MyriMatch " database search engine, places greater emphasis on matching intense peaks. The probability that the best match for each spectrum has occurred by random chance can be employed to separate correct matches from random ones. We evaluated this software on data sets from three different laboratories employing three different ion trap instruments. Employing a novel system for testing discrimination, we demonstrate that stratifying peaks into multiple intensity classes improves the discrimination of scoring. We compare MyriMatch results to those of Sequest and X!Tandem, revealing that it is capable of higher discrimination than either of these algorithms. When minimal peak filtering is employed, performance plummets for a scoring model that does not stratify matched peaks by intensity. On the other hand, we find that MyriMatch discrimination improves as more peaks are retained in each spectrum. MyriMatch also scales well to tandem mass spectra from high-resolution mass analyzers. These findings may indicate limitations for existing database search scorers that count matched peaks without differentiating them by intensity.

@article{Bolstad2004,
abstract = {Microarray experiments are currently widely applied in many areas of biomedical research. The Affymetrix GeneChip{\textregistered} system is a commercial high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform which measures gene expression using hundreds of thousands of 25-mer oligonucleotide probes. This dissertation addresses how probe intensity data from GeneChips{\textregistered} are processed to produce gene expression values and shows how better pre-processing leads to gene expression measures, that after further analysis, yield biologically meaningful conclusions. An ideal expression measure is one which is both precise and accurate. A three-stage procedure for producing an expression measure is proposed. For each of the three stages, background correction, normalization and summarization, numerous methods are developed and assessed using spike-in datasets. Bias and variance criteria are used to compare the different methods of producing expression values. The methods are also judged by how well they correctly identify the differential genes. The background method has a significant effect on the bias, which is reduced, and the variability, which is usually increased. Non-linear normalization methods are found to reduce the non-biological variability between multiple arrays without introducing any significant bias. Robust multi-chip linear models are found to fit the data well and provide the recommended summarization method. The summarization methodology is extended to produce test statistics for determining differential genes. These test statistics perform favorably at correctly detecting differential genes when compared with alternative methods based on expression values. Finally, using case study data, no statistical benefit is found for using arrays hybridized with mRNA from a pool rather than from a single biological source. Professor},

abstract = {The interleukin (IL) 17 family of cytokines has emerged to be critical for host defense as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and serves to link adaptive and innate responses. Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 19:652657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. Immunity. 21:467476), but the regulation of IL-17 production by innate immune cells is less well understood. We report that in vitro stimulation with IL-23 induced IL-17 production by recombination activating gene (Rag) 2/ splenocytes but not Rag2/ common $\gamma$ chain/ splenocytes. We found that a major source of IL-17 was cells, a phenotype that corresponds to lymphoid tissue inducerlike cells (LTi-like cells), which constitutively expressed the IL-23 receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and CCR6. In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced IL-17 production in these cells. Genetic deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reduced but did not abrogate IL-17 production in LTi-like cells. Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of IL-17 and IL-22, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.},

abstract = {We extended the use of Peplook, an in silico procedure for the prediction of three-dimensional (3D) models of linear peptides to the prediction of 3D models of cyclic peptides and thanks to the ab initio calculation procedure, to the calculation of peptides with non-proteinogenic amino acids. Indeed, such peptides cannot be predicted by homology or threading. We compare the calculated models with NMR and X-ray models and for the cyclic peptides, with models predicted by other in silico procedures (Pep-Fold and I-Tasser). For cyclic peptides, on a set of 38 peptides, average root mean square deviation of backbone atoms (BB-RMSD) was 3.8 and 4.1 {\AA} for Peplook and Pep-Fold, respectively. The best results are obtained with I-Tasser (2.5 {\AA}) although evaluations were biased by the fact that the resolved Protein Data Bank models could be used as template by the server. Peplook and Pep-Fold give similar results, better for short (up to 20 residues) than for longer peptides. For peptides with non-proteinogenic residues, performances of Peplook are sound with an average BB-RMSD of 3.6 {\AA} for 'non-natural peptides' and 3.4 {\AA} for peptides combining non-proteinogenic residues and cyclic structure. These results open interesting possibilities for the design of peptidic drugs.},

abstract = {Hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells initiate lymph node (LN) and Peyer's patch (PP) development during fetal life by inducing the differentiation of mesenchymal organizer cells. The growth factor signals underlying LTi cell development and LN and PP organogenesis remain poorly understood. LTi cells express the Il7r and the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit, whereas organizer cells express their cognate ligands. To determine the relative significance of Il7 and Kit signaling in LTi cell homeostasis and PP and LN development, we have analyzed mice deficient for Kit (Kit(W/Wv)), Il7 (Il7(-/-)), or both (Il7(-/-) Kit(W/Wv)). Unlike Kit(W/Wv) and Il7(-/-) single mutants, Il7(-/-) Kit(W/Wv) mice were almost devoid of LTi cells in their mesenteric LN anlage. This LTi deficiency was associated with a block in mesenchymal LN organizer cell generation and the absence of almost all LNs. In contrast, intestinal LTi cell numbers, PP organizer cell generation, and PP development were strongly affected by impaired Kit signaling, but were independent of Il7. Hence, Kit and Il7 act synergistically in LN organogenesis, whereas Kit signaling, but not Il7, critically regulates PP organogenesis and LTi cell numbers in the intestine. Consistent with these differential growth factor requirements for PP and LN development, PP organizer cells expressed higher Kitl and lower Il7 levels than did LN organizer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Kit and Il7 differentially control PP and LN organogenesis through the local growth factor-driven regulation of LTi cell numbers.},

abstract = {Within the past 10 years, the use of saliva as a diagnostic tool has gained considerable attention and become a well-accepted method. As a diagnostic fluid, saliva offers superiority over serum due to both a noninvasive collection method by specially trained persons and a cost-effective approach for screening of large populations. Collection of saliva offers a reduced risk of infection compared to the collection of serum. Moreover, obtaining saliva samples from infant, disabled or anxious patients, is much easier than obtaining other samples. There is a lot of useful components-changing information in saliva when a person is in sick. Therefore, we define these changing components as "biomarkers". The utilization of biomarkers as early predictors for clinical disease not only contributes to the effective prevention and treatment of diseases, but also enhances the assessment of potential health risks. In this article, we have reviewed the properties of saliva, the salivary analysis method for biomarker discovery, and the diagnostic potentials of salivary biomarkers in monitoring and detecting periodontal disease, Oral and Breast cancers, and Sj??gren's syndrome. We also discussed some barriers of applications of saliva as a diagnostic media as well as recent improvements. We also prospected the future processing directions of using biomarkers in disease diagnosis and draw a conclusion that saliva is indeed an effective media in various disease monitoring and diagnosis. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aluminum compounds are the only adjuvants used widely with routine human vaccines and are the most common adjuvants in veterinary vaccines also. Though there has been a search for alternate adjuvants, aluminum adjuvants will continue to be used for many years due to their good track record of safety, low cost and adjuvanticity with a variety of antigens. For infections that can be prevented by induction of serum antibodies, aluminum adjuvants formulated under optimal conditions are the adjuvants of choice. It is important to select carefully the type of aluminum adjuvant and optimize the conditions of adsorption for every antigen since this process is dependent upon the physico-chemical characteristics of both the antigens and aluminum adjuvants. Adsorption of antigens onto aluminum compounds depends heavily on electrostatic forces between adjuvant and antigen. Two commonly used aluminum adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate have opposite charge at a neutral pH. The mechanism of adjuvanticity of aluminum compounds includes formation of a depot; efficient uptake of aluminum adsorbed antigen particles by antigen presenting cells due their particulate nature and optimal size ({\textless} 10 ??m); and stimulation of immune competent cells of the body through activation of complement, induction of eosinophilia and activation of macrophages. Limitations of aluminum adjuvants include local reactions, augmentation of IgE antibody responses, ineffectiveness for some antigens and inability to augment cell-mediated immune responses, especially cytotoxic T- cell responses.},

abstract = {Batch effects are responsible for the failure of promising genomic prognostic signatures, major ambiguities in published genomic results, and retractions of widely-publicized findings. Batch effect corrections have been developed to remove these artifacts, but they are designed to be used in population studies. But genomic technologies are beginning to be used in clinical applications where samples are analyzed one at a time for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive applications. There are currently no batch correction methods that have been developed specifically for prediction. In this paper, we propose an new method called frozen surrogate variable analysis (fSVA) that borrows strength from a training set for individual sample batch correction. We show that fSVA improves prediction accuracy in simulations and in public genomic studies. fSVA is available as part of the sva Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {False discovery rate (FDR) methodologies are essential in the study of high-dimensional genomic and proteomic data. The R package 'fdrtool' facilitates such analyses by offering a comprehensive set of procedures for FDR estimation. Its distinctive features include: (i) many different types of test statistics are allowed as input data, such as P-values, z-scores, correlations and t-scores; (ii) simultaneously, both local FDR and tail area-based FDR values are estimated for all test statistics and (iii) empirical null models are fit where possible, thereby taking account of potential over- or underdispersion of the theoretical null. In addition, 'fdrtool' provides readily interpretable graphical output, and can be applied to very large scale (in the order of millions of hypotheses) multiple testing problems. Consequently, 'fdrtool' implements a flexible FDR estimation scheme that is unified across different test statistics and variants of FDR.

abstract = {Immunomodulation by nanoparticles, especially as related to the biochemical properties of these unique materials, has scarcely been explored. In an in vitro model of human immunity, we demonstrate two catalytic nanoparticles, TiO2 (oxidant) and CeO2 (antioxidant), have nearly opposite effects on human dendritic cells and T helper (TH) cells. For example, whereas TiO2 nanoparticles potentiated DC maturation that led towards TH1-biased responses, treatment with antioxidant CeO2 nanoparticles induced APCs to secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and induce a TH2-dominated T cell profile. In subsequent studies, we demonstrate these results are likely explained by the disparate capacities of the nanoparticles to modulate ROS, since TiO2, but not CeO2 NPs, induced inflammatory responses through an ROS/inflammasome/IL-1$\beta$ pathway. This novel capacity of metallic NPs to regulate innate and adaptive immunity in profoundly different directions via their ability to modulate dendritic cell function has strong implications for human health since unintentional exposure to these materials is common in modern societies.},

abstract = {Antibodies are of importance for the field of proteomics, both as reagents for imaging cells, tissues, and organs and as capturing agents for affinity enrichment in mass-spectrometry-based techniques. It is important to gain basic insights regarding the binding sites (epitopes) of antibodies and potential cross-reactivity to nontarget proteins. Knowledge about an antibody's linear epitopes is also useful in, for instance, developing assays involving the capture of peptides obtained from trypsin cleavage of samples prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we describe, for the first time, the design and use of peptide arrays covering all human proteins for the analysis of antibody specificity, based on parallel in situ photolithic synthesis of a total of 2.1 million overlapping peptides. This has allowed analysis of on- and off-target binding of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, complemented with precise mapping of epitopes based on full amino acid substitution scans. The analysis suggests that linear epitopes are relatively short, confined to five to seven residues, resulting in apparent off-target binding to peptides corresponding to a large number of unrelated human proteins. However, subsequent analysis using recombinant proteins suggests that these linear epitopes have a strict conformational component, thus giving us new insights regarding how antibodies bind to their antigens.},

abstract = {Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after cancer treatment. This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.},

abstract = {Saliva is a clear, watery biofluid produced by the salivary glands to protect and lubricate the oral cavity. While mostly composed of water (99 {\%}), the chemical composition of saliva is known to change quite dramatically in response to a variety of different physiological states, stimuli, insults and stressors. Unfortunately, among the human biofluids typically used in medical testing (such as blood and urine), saliva is rarely used. Given that saliva is the most easily accessible and readily obtained biofluid, this is rather unfortunate. Part of the reluctance to use saliva in medical testing likely has to do with the fact that its chemical composition is not well known. Here, a comprehensive characterization of the human saliva metabolome is presented. Multiple analytical platforms including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, direct flow injection/liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and high performance liquid chromatography were employed to quantify the metabolites that can be commonly detected in human saliva. Using this multiplatform approach, we were able to quantify and/or identify 308 salivary metabolites or metabolite species in human saliva. This experimental work was complemented with computer-aided literature mining that led to the identification and annotation of another 708 salivary metabolites. The combined collection of 853 non-redundant salivary metabolites or metabolite species together with their concentrations, related literature references, and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.hmdb.ca/.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry accurately identifies both selected bacteria and bacteria in select clinical situations. It has not been evaluated for routine use in the clinic. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed routine MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification in parallel with conventional phenotypic identification of bacteria regardless of phylum or source of isolation. Discrepancies were resolved by 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoB gene sequence-based molecular identification. Colonies (4 spots per isolate directly deposited on the MALDI-TOF plate) were analyzed using an Autoflex II Bruker Daltonik mass spectrometer. Peptidic spectra were compared with the Bruker BioTyper database, version 2.0, and the identification score was noted. Delays and costs of identification were measured. RESULTS: Of 1660 bacterial isolates analyzed, 95.4{\%} were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; 84.1{\%} were identified at the species level, and 11.3{\%} were identified at the genus level. In most cases, absence of identification (2.8{\%} of isolates) and erroneous identification (1.7{\%} of isolates) were due to improper database entries. Accurate MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification was significantly correlated with having 10 reference spectra in the database (P=.01). The mean time required for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification of 1 isolate was 6 minutes for an estimated 22{\%}-32{\%} cost of current methods of identification. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a cost-effective, accurate method for routine identification of bacterial isolates in {\textless}1 h using a database comprising {\textgreater} or =10 reference spectra per bacterial species and a 1.9 identification score (Brucker system). It may replace Gram staining and biochemical identification in the near future.},

abstract = {Analysis of antibody responses to self-antigens has driven the development of the field of tumor immunology, with the identification of many protein targets found in cancer but with limited expression in normal tissues. Protein microarray technologies offer an unprecedented platform to assay the serological response of cancer patients to tumor antigens in a comprehensive fashion, against many proteins simultaneously. We developed an array containing 329 full-length proteins, originally identified as antigenic in various cancer patients by serological expression cloning (SEREX), that were immobilized as folded, functional products accessible for antibody binding. To validate the use of these microarrays, we selected 31 sera from non-small cell lung cancer patients previously known to react to the following antigens by ELISA: LAGE-1/CTAG2, MAGEA4, TP53, SSX and SOX2. These sera were compared with 22 sera from healthy donors for reactivity against a series of antigens present on microarrays. The sensitivity and specificity of the arrays compared favorably with standard ELISA techniques (94{\%} concordance). We present here a stringent strategy for data analysis and normalization that is applicable to protein arrays in general, and describe findings suggesting that this approach is suitable for defining potential antigenic targets for cancer vaccine development, serum antibody signatures with clinical value, characterization of predictive serum markers for experimental therapeutics, and eventually for the serological definition of the cancer proteome (seromics). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Protein antigenic determinants have been classified as continuous or discontinuous. The continuous determinants are composed of residues which are local in the polypeptide sequence, while discontinuous determinants consist of residues from different parts of the sequence, brought together by the folding of the protein to its native structure. Searches made for protein determinants using peptide fragments which compete with protein-antibody complex formation, or peptides that can be used to raise antibodies which crossreact with the native protein, are limited to the simulation of continuous determinants. However, recent experiments suggest that most determinants are discontinuous. We now show, by consideration of protein surfaces, that if the recognition zone between a protein and antibody has the same dimensions as those found for the lysozyme-antibody complex, none of the protein{\{}{\&}{\}}apos;s surface will be {\{}{\&}{\}}apos;continuous{\{}{\&}{\}}apos;. We suggest that all determinants are discontinuous to some extent, and that crossreacting peptides mimic only the {\{}{\&}{\}}apos;primary{\{}{\&}{\}}apos; interaction site. In addition, we show that the parts of a protein{\{}{\&}{\}}apos;s surface which are most continuous fall predominantly in the loops and/or protruding regions. This explains why quantities such as hydrophilicity, accessibility, mobility and protrusion can be used to predict which parts of a polypeptide provide the {\{}{\&}{\}}apos;best{\{}{\&}{\}}apos; antigenic peptides.},

abstract = {A fusion phage is a filamentous virion displaying on its surface a foreign peptide fused to a coat protein and harboring the gene for the fusion protein within its genome. This chapter emphasizes an application for which these surface expression vectors are particularly well suited: construction of epitope libraries. In such a library—the kind so far constructed—the phages display random foreign peptides encoded by degenerate synthetic oligonucleotides spliced into the coat protein gene, the library as a whole representing up to billions of peptide sequences. Affinity purified phages are eluted without destroying their infectivity, and the peptide sequences responsible for binding are easily ascertained by infecting the eluted phages into bacteria, propagating the resulting phage clones, and sequencing the relevant part of their viral DNAs. The number of peptides that can be accommodated with this technology exceeds by a factor of 100–1,000 the number that can be screened with conventional expression systems, in which the epitope is not displayed as part of the propagatable unit that encodes it. It also discusses more complex libraries, in which the displayed ligands are whole folded domains.},

abstract = {Spotted cDNA microarrays are emerging as a powerful and cost-effective tool for large-scale analysis of gene expression. Microarrays can be used to measure the relative quantities of specific mRNAs in two or more tissue samples for thousands of genes simultaneously. While the power of this technology has been recognized, many open questions remain about appropriate analysis of microarray data. One question is how to make valid estimates of the relative expression for genes that are not biased by ancillary sources of variation. Recognizing that there is inherent "noise" in microarray data, how does one estimate the error variation associated with an estimated change in expression, i.e., how does one construct the error bars? We demonstrate that ANOVA methods can be used to normalize microarray data and provide estimates of changes in gene expression that are corrected for potential confounding effects. This approach establishes a framework for the general analysis and interpretation of microarray data.},

While a similar mechanism may serve to amplify immune system activation and production of inflammatory mediators in vivo in the context of systemic autoimmune diseases, the initial triggers of autoimmunity have not been defined. In this review, we describe a category of potential inducers of autoimmunity, the endogenous retroelements, with a particular focus on long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1, L1). Increased expression of L1 transcripts or decreased degradation of L1 DNA or RNA could provide potent stimuli for an innate immune response, priming of the immune system, and induction of autoimmunity and inflammation. Genomic and genetic variations among individuals, sex-related differences in L1 regulation, and environmental triggers are among the potential mechanisms that might account for increased L1 expression. Induction of type I IFN by L1-enriched nucleic acids through TLR-independent pathways could represent a first step in the complex series of events leading to systemic autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {Glucose-reduced glucose oxidase does not directly transfer electrons to conventional electrodes because the distance between its redox centers and the electrode surface exceeds, even on closest approach, the distance across which electrons are transferred at sufficient rates. Therefore, electrical communication between the redox centers of this enzyme and electrodes required either the presence, and diffusion to and from the enzyme's redox center, of 0, and H 2 0 2 , or the presence of members of a redox couple, or the use of special electrodes like TTFITCNQ. We show here that direct electrical communication between the redox center of a large enzyme molecule and a simple metal electrode can be established through chemical modification of the enzyme. When a sufficient number of electron-relaying centers are attached through covalent bonding to the protein of glucose oxidase, electrons are transferred from the enzyme's redox centers to relays that are closer to the periphery of the enzyme. Because some of the relays are located sufficiently close to the enzyme's surface, electrons are transferred at practical rates to the electrode. As a result, a glucose-concentration-dependent current flows i n an electrochemical cell made with conventional electrodes when the electrolytic solution contains the relay-modified enzyme. Such a current does not flow when the solution contains the natural enzyme. Specifically, electrical communication is established between the FADIFADH, centers of glucose oxidase and gold, platinum, or carbon electrodes through the covalent bonding of an average of 12 molecules of ferrocenecarboxylic acid per glucose oxidase molecule. The electron-relaying centers are amides of ferrocenecarboxylic acid and primary protein amines. Over 50{\%} of the catalytic activity of the enzyme is retained after the centers for electron transfer are introduced. In pH 7.2 solutions containing the chemically modified enzyme, glucose is electrochemically oxidized a t potentials that are more oxidizing than +0.44 Y (SHE)},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Three sizes (80, 170 and 240nm) of poly methoxypolyethyleneglycol cyanoacrylate-co-n-hexadecyl cyanoacrylate (PEG-PHDCA) nanoparticles loading recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) were prepared at different MePEG molecular weights (MW=2000, 5000 and 10,000) using double emulsion method. The opsonization in mouse serum was evaluated by Coomassie brilliant blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Phagocytosis was evaluated by incubating (125)I-rHuTNF-alpha-loaded nanoparticles with mouse macrophages (RAW264.7). The pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and tumor targeting studies were performed in S-180 tumor-bearing mice. Higher MePEG molecular weight provided thicker fixed aqueous layer thickness (FALT) and smaller particle size offered higher surface MePEG density. The serum protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake were markedly decreased for the nanoparticles with higher MePEG molecular weight or smaller size. The particles (80nm) made of PEG(5000)-PHDCA, possessing a thicker FALT (5.16nm) and a shortest distance (0.87nm) between two neighboring MePEG chains, showed the strongest capacity of decreasing protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake. These particles extended the half-life of rHuTNF-alpha in S-180 tumor-bearing mice by 24-fold (from 28.2 min to 11.33 h), elevated the rHuTNF-alpha peak concentration in S-180 tumors by 2.85-fold and increased the area under the intratumoral rHuTNF-alpha concentration curve by 7.44-fold. The results of the present study showed PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles with higher MePEG molecular weight and smaller particle size could achieve higher in vivo tumor targeting efficiency.},

abstract = {cDNAmicroarrays permit us to study the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. They are now used in many different contexts to compare mRNA levels between two or more samples of cells. Microarray experiments typically give us expression measurements on a large number of genes, say 10,000-20,000, but with few, if any, replicates for each gene. Traditional methods using means and standard deviations to detect differential expression are not completely satisfactory in this context, and so a different approach seems desirable. In this paper we present an empirical Bayes method for analysing replicated microarray data. Data from all the genes in a replicate set of experiments are combined into estimates of parameters of a prior distribution. These parameter estimates are then combined at the gene level with means and standard deviations to form a statistic B which can be used to decide whether differential expression has occurred. The statistic B avoids the problems of using averages or t-statistics. The method is illustrated using data from an experiment comparing the expression of genes in the livers of SR-BI transgenic mice with that of the corresponding wild-type mice. In addition we present the results of a simulation study estimating the ROC curve of B and three other statistics for determining differential expression: the average and two simple modifications of the usual t-statistic. B was found to be the most powerful of the four, though the margin was not great. The data were simulated to resemble the SR-BI data. Key},

With the availability of fast and inexpensive computing, their main limitation would be some lack of flexibility to work with arbitrary experimental designs. In this paper we report on results on approximate permutation methods that are more flexible with respect to the experimental design and nuisance variables, and conduct detailed simulations to identify the best method for settings that are typical for imaging research scenarios. We present a generic framework for permutation inference for complex general linear models (glms) when the errors are exchangeable and/or have a symmetric distribution, and show that, even in the presence of nuisance effects, these permutation inferences are powerful while providing excellent control of false positives in a wide range of common and relevant imaging research scenarios. We also demonstrate how the inference on glm parameters, originally intended for independent data, can be used in certain special but useful cases in which independence is violated. Detailed examples of common neuroimaging applications are provided, as well as a complete algorithm - the "randomise" algorithm - for permutation inference with the GLM. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {A unique design paradigm to form core-shell particles based on interfacial radical polymerization is described. The interfacial initiation system is comprised of an enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase (GOx) to generate hydrogen peroxide, which, in the presence of iron (Fe(2+)), generates hydroxyl radicals that initiate polymerization. Shell formation on prefabricated polymeric cores is achieved by localizing the initiation reaction to the interface of the core and a surrounding aqueous monomer formulation into which it is immersed. The interfacially confined initiation reaction is accomplished by incorporating one or more of the initiating species in the particle core and the remainder of the complementary initiating components in the surrounding media such that interactions and the resulting initiation reaction occur at the interface. This work is focused on engineering the reaction behavior and mass transport processes to promote interfacially confined polymerization, controlling the rate of shell formation, and manipulating the structure of the core-shell particle. Specifically, incorporating GOx in the precursor solution used to fabricate cores ranging from 100 to 200 $\mu$m, and the remainder of the complementary initiating components and monomer in the bulk solution prior to interfacial polymerization yielded shells whose average thickness was 20 $\mu$m after 4 min of immersion and at a bulk iron concentration of 12.5 mM. When the locations of glucose and GOx are interchanged, the average thickness of the shell was 15 or 100 $\mu$m for bulk iron concentrations of 45 and 12.5 mM, respectively. The initial locations of glucose and GOx also determine the degree of interpenetration of the core and the shell. Specifically, for a bulk iron concentration of 45 mM, the thickness of the interpenetrating layer averaged 12 $\mu$m when GOx was initially within the core, whereas no interpenetrating layer was observed when glucose was incorporated in the core. The polymeric shell formed by this technique is also demonstrated to be self-supporting following core degradation. This behavior is accomplished by fabricating the particle core hydrogel from monomers possessing degradable groups that can be irreversibly cleaved by light exposure following shell formation. When the coated particle was exposed to light, the shell remained intact while the core degraded as evidenced by a dramatic change in diffusion coefficient of fluorescent beads immobilized within the core.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Lack of detection technology for early pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. New strategies and biomarkers for early detection are sorely needed. In this study, we have conducted a prospective sample collection and retrospective blinded validation to evaluate the performance and translational utilities of salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of resectable pancreatic cancer. Methods: The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to profile transcriptomes and discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. Biomarkers discovered from the microarray study were subjected to clinical validation using an independent sample set of 30 pancreatic cancer patients, 30 chronic pancreatitis patients, and 30 healthy controls. Results: Twelve messenger RNA biomarkers were discovered and validated. The logistic regression model with the combination of 4 messenger RNA biomarkers (KRAS, MBD3L2, ACRV1, and DPM1) could differentiate pancreatic cancer patients from noncancer subjects (chronic pancreatitis and healthy control), yielding a receiver operating characteristic plot, area under the curve value of 0.971 with 90.0{\%} sensitivity and 95.0{\%} specificity. Conclusions: The salivary biomarkers possess discriminatory power for the detection of resectable pancreatic cancer, with high specificity and sensitivity. This report provides the proof of concept of salivary biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of a systemic cancer and paves the way for prediction model validation study followed by pivotal clinical validation. {\textcopyright} 2010 AGA Institute.},

Felsenstein's method, which in concept is a straightforward application of the bootstrap, is widely used, but has been criticized as biased in the genetics literature. This paper concerns the use of the bootstrap in the tree problem. We show that Felsenstein's method is not biased, but that it can be corrected to better agree with standard ideas of confidence levels and hypothesis testing. These corrections can be made by using the more elaborate bootstrap method presented here, at the expense of considerably more computation.},

By systematic analysis of the IL-12-induced immune response to subcutaneous melanoma (B16), we found that tumor suppression was mediated independently of T lymphocytes or NK cells. IL-12 initiated local antitumor immunity by stimulating a subset of NKp46(+) lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells dependent on the transcription factor ROR$\gamma$t. The presence of these NKp46(+) LTi cells induced upregulation of adhesion molecules in the tumor vasculature and resulted in more leukocyte invasion. Thus, this innate cell type is responsive to IL-12 and is a powerful mediator of tumor suppression.},

The most widely used methods successfully test whether the true differential expression is different from zero, but give no assurance that the differences found are large enough to be biologically meaningful. RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes.

Manual microscope-based testing and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) are the current standard methods to diagnose male infertility; however, these methods are labor-intensive, expensive, and laboratory-based. Cultural and socially dominated stigma against male infertility testing hinders a large number of men from getting tested for infertility, especially in resource-limited African countries. We describe the development and clinical test-ing of an automated smartphone-based semen analyzer designed for quantitative measurement of sperm concen-tration and motility for point-of-care male infertility screening. Using a total of 350 clinical semen specimens at a fertility clinic, we have shown that our assay can analyze an unwashed, unprocessed liquefied semen sample with {\textless}5-s mean processing time and provide the user a semen quality evaluation based on the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) guidelines with {\~{}}98{\%} accuracy.

abstract = {The addition of latex particles to native (no anticoagulant) or citrated human platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or to a once-washed platelet suspension causes platelet aggregation. This aggregation is associated with phagocytosis of the latex particles by the platelets and appears to be due to release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from the platelets. Adenosine and adenosine monophosphate, which are known to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP, also block that induced by latex. These compounds do not prevent the phagocytosis of latex particles by the platelet. The addition of iodoacetate and 2,4-dinitrophenol in appropriate concentrations to the PRP, prior to the addition of the latex, blocks platelet aggregation and phagocytosis. This is also true for the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Platelets left in contact with latex for a sufficient period of time show loss of their granules. Leucocytes phagocytose both latex and platelets that had themselves phagocytosed latex. It is concluded that phagocytosis of latex particles by platelets resembles that by white cells, and that in both processes metabolic changes appear to be involved.},

The micelle formed via the dialysis method was approximately 95 nm in diameter and contained 15 wt.{\%} of doxorubicin (DOX) by weight. The micelle surface hides TAT during circulation, which has the strong capability to translocate the micelle into cells, and exposes TAT at a slightly acidic tumor extracellular pH to facilitate the internalization process. The micelle core was engineered for disintegration in early endosomal pH of tumor cells, quickly releasing DOX. The ionization process of the block copolymers and ionized polymers assisted in disrupting the endosomal membrane. This processes permitted high DOX concentrations in the cytosol and its target site of the nucleus, thus increasing DOX potency in various wild and multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines (3.8-8.8 times lower IC50 than free DOX, depending on cell line). When tested with the xenografted tumors of human ovarian tumor drug-resistant A2780/AD, human breast tumor drug-sensitive MCF-7, human lung tumor A549 and human epidermoid tumor KB in a nude mice model, all tumors significantly regressed in size by three bolus injections at a dose of DOX 10 mg equivalent/kg body per injection of DOX-loaded micelle at three day interval, while minimum weight loss was observed. This approach may replace the need for cell-specific antibodies or targeting ligands, thereby providing a general strategy for solid tumor targeting.},

Age was associated positively with IgA and IgG levels. Smoking was associated negatively with IgG levels. Heavy drinking was associated positively with IgA levels. Metabolic abnormalities (obesity and metabolic syndrome) were associated positively with IgA levels. Abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridaemia were the components of metabolic syndrome associated most strongly with serum IgA. Heavy drinkers with metabolic syndrome showed particularly high serum IgA levels. Serum IL-6 levels were correlated positively with IgA and IgG concentrations. It is concluded that sex, age, alcohol consumption, smoking and common metabolic abnormalities should be taken into account when interpreting serum levels of IgA, IgG and IgM.},

abstract = {CD4(+) T cells are prominent effector cells in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection but may also contribute to immunopathology. Studies probing the CD4(+) T cell response from individuals latently infected with Mtb or patients with active tuberculosis using either small or proteome-wide antigen screens so far revealed a multi-antigenic, yet mostly invariable repertoire of immunogenic Mtb proteins. Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have highlighted the occurrence of numerous types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteomes of prokaryotes, including Mtb. The well-known PTMs in Mtb are glycosylation, lipidation, or phosphorylation, known regulators of protein function or compartmentalization. Other PTMs include methylation, acetylation, and pupylation, involved in protein stability. While all PTMs add variability to the Mtb proteome, relatively little is understood about their role in the anti-Mtb immune responses. Here, we review Mtb protein PTMs and methods to assess their role in protective immunity against Mtb.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis is an essential process involved in the normal growth and differentiation. In its defective and excessive form, angiogenesis is a crucial event in the progression of many human diseases. Excessive angiogenesis was largely investigated in psoriasis, arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and malignant tumours. Soon after the discovery of angiogenic factors and their inhibitors, the angiogenesis jumped from the experimental studies to clinical application. Tumour-associated angiogenesis is nowadays considered as a priority in oncology based on numerous evidences that showed a significant reduction in tumour growth following anti-angiogenic therapy. However, few data are available on pre-malignant conditions. First evidences on angiogenesis in pre-malignant lesions came from the evaluation of microvessel density (MVD). MVD was found to be significantly increased in a relatively large spectrum of pre-malignant squamous cell lesions, such as in the oral mucosa, skin, uterine cervix, vulva and anal canal. For many of them, a correlation was found between MVD and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Based on these data, it was suggested that tumour angiogenesis is not necessarily a characteristic of invasive tumour, but may be an early event during tumourigenesis. Additional evidences came from pre-malignant lesions of glandular epithelia, in which the angiogenic switch was demonstrated by the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in gastric metaplasia and dysplasia, in atypical adenoma of the colon, atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ of the breast and others. Actually, there are convincing evidences for an active angiogenesis in many cases with pre-malignant conditions, and this supports a more accurate evaluation of different chemopreventive agents.},

abstract = {This study examines dose effects of cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe-QDs) from two commercial sources on model macrophages (J774A.1) and colonic epithelial cells (HT29). Effects on cellular immune signalling responses were measured following sequential exposure to QDs and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA01. At CdTe-QD concentrations between 10(-2) and 10 µg/ml, cells exhibited changes in metabolism and morphology. Confocal imaging revealed QD internalisation and changes in cell-cell contacts, shapes and internal organisations. QD doses below 10(-2) µg/ml caused no observed effects. When QD exposures at 10(-7) to 10(-3) µg/ml preceded PA01 (10(7) bacteria/ml) challenges, there were elevated cytotoxicity (5-22{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05) and reduced levels (two- to fivefold, p {\textless} 0.001) of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-$\alpha$, KC/CXC-1 and IL-8, compared with PA01 exposures alone. These results demonstrate that exposures to sub-toxic levels of CdTe-QDs can depress cell immune-defence functions, which if occurred in vivo would likely interfere with normal neutrophil recruitment for defence against bacteria.},

abstract = {LINE1s occupy 17{\%} of the human genome and are its only active autonomous mobile DNA. L1s are also responsible for genomic insertion of processed pseudogenes and {\textgreater}1 million non-autonomous retrotransposons (Alus and SVAs). These elements have significant effects on gene organization and expression. Despite the importance of retrotransposons for genome evolution, much about their biology remains unknown, including cellular factors involved in the complex processes of retrotransposition and forming and transporting L1 ribonucleoprotein particles. By co-immunoprecipitation of tagged L1 constructs and mass spectrometry, we identified proteins associated with the L1 ORF1 protein and its ribonucleoprotein. These include RNA transport proteins, gene expression regulators, post-translational modifiers, helicases and splicing factors. Many cellular proteins co-localize with L1 ORF1 protein in cytoplasmic granules. We also assayed the effects of these proteins on cell culture retrotransposition and found strong inhibiting proteins, including some that control HIV and other retroviruses. These data suggest candidate cofactors that interact with the L1 to modulate its activity and increase our understanding of the means by which the cell coexists with these genomic 'parasites'.},

Drug doses can be monitored without inconvenient and costly visits to blood-drawing facilities. Antibody levels can be determined to screen for infectious diseases. Saliva can be collected directly by spitting into a tube or with one of several devices, each of which has its own special advantages and disadvantages. Salivary levels of steroid hormones and other analytes that are protein bound in serum reflect the unbound and active concentration of the hormone.

abstract = {An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.},

We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

An important step in a typical workflow is the combination of results from multiple LC-MS experiments to improve confidence in the obtained measurements or to compare results from different samples. To do so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to be estimated. The alignment has to correct for variations in mass and elution time which are present in all mass spectrometry experiments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a novel algorithm to align LC-MS samples and to match corresponding ion species across samples. Our algorithm matches landmark signals between two data sets using a geometric technique based on pose clustering. Variations in mass and retention time are corrected by an affine dewarping function estimated from matched landmarks. We use the pairwise dewarping in an algorithm for aligning multiple samples. We show that our pose clustering approach is fast and reliable as compared to previous approaches. It is robust in the presence of noise and able to accurately align samples with only few common ion species. In addition, we can easily handle different kinds of LC-MS data and adopt our algorithm to new mass spectrometry technologies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: This algorithm is implemented as part of the OpenMS software library for shotgun proteomics and available under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) at www.openms.de.},

The objective of this study is to investigate changes in the plasma protein adsorption patterns in the course of surface hydrophobicity variation. Latex particles with decreasing surface hydrophobicity were synthesized as model colloidal carriers.

abstract = {Currently, there is a need for therapeutic vaccines that are effective in inducing robust T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses capable of mediating viral clearance in chronic hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B therapeutic vaccines were designed and formulated by loading the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) into poly(D,L-lactic-acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with or without monophospholipid A (MPLA), a Th1-favoring immunomodulator. These particles were around 300 nm in diameter, spherical in shape and had approximately 50{\%} HBcAg encapsulation efficiency. A single immunization with a vaccine formulation containing (MPLA+HBcAg) coformulated in PLGA nanoparticles induced a stronger Th1 cellular immune response with a predominant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) profile than those induced by HBcAg alone, free (HBcAg+MPLA) simple mixture or HBcAg-loaded nanoparticles in a murine model. More importantly, the level of HBcAg-specific IFN-gamma production could be increased further significantly by a booster immunization with the (HBcAg+MPLA)-loaded nanoparticles. In summary, these results demonstrated that codelivery of HBcAg and MPLA in PLGA nanoparticles promoted HBcAg-specific Th1 immune responses with IFN-gamma production. These findings suggest that appropriate design of the vaccine formulation and careful planning of the immunization schedule are important in the successful development of effective HBV therapeutic vaccines.},

abstract = {Plasma protein adsorption is regarded as a key factor for the in vivo organ distribution of intravenously administered colloidal drug carriers, and strongly depends on their surface characteristics, e.g. surface hydrophobicity or charge. A range of polymeric nanoparticles with a steep variation of the surface charge density was synthesized as model drug carriers. Physicochemical parameters, i.e. particle size, surface charge density, hydrophobicity and surface topography were determined. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was employed for determination of particle interactions with human plasma proteins. Increasing surface charge density showed an increase in plasma protein adsorption, but did not show differences in the detected protein species. For the first time it was possible to show plasma protein adsorption patterns on a range of nanoparticles with variation of only one parameter, i.e. the charge, while size and surface hydrophobicity remain practically unchanged. The knowledge about the interactions of proteins with particulate surfaces can be exploited for the future controlled design of colloidal drug carriers and possibly in the controlled creation of biocompatible surfaces of other devices that come into contact with proteins (e.g. microparticles and implants).},

abstract = {Cancer biomarker refers to a substance or process that is indicative of the presence of cancer in the body. A biomarker might be either a molecule secreted by a tumor or it can be a specific response of the body to the presence of cancer. Cancer biomarker-based diagnostics have applications for establishing disease predisposition, early detection, cancer staging, therapy selection, identifying whether or not a cancer is metastatic, therapy monitoring, assessing prognosis, and advances in the adjuvant setting. Full adoption of cancer biomarkers in the clinic has to date been slow, and only a limited number of cancer biomarker products are currently in routine use. Among proteomic technologies, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) is a technique that has allowed rapid progress in cancer biology. Different further developed methods including e.g. SELDI (surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization) and MELDI (material-enhanced laser desorption/ionization) are simple and high-throughput techniques that analyze with high sensitivity and specificity intact proteins expressed in complex biological mixtures, such as serum, urine, and tissues. The combination of mass spectrometry (MS) with infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging is an attempt to combine different technologies in systems analytics. Both MALDI-TOF and infrared tissue imaging enable studying proteins distribution in tissue samples with a resolution down to 50 and 5 $\mu$m, respectively. In this review, we summarize recent applications and the synergistic combination of these new technologies to proteomic profiling for cancer biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {The focus of this review paper is factors affecting data interpretation in ligand binding assays under equilibrium conditions. Protocols for determining K(d) (the equilibrium dissociation constant) and K(dA) (the equilibrium inhibitor constant) for receptor ligands are discussed. The basic theory describing the interaction of a radiotracer and an unlabelled competitor ligand with a receptor is developed. Inappropriate experimental design may result in ligand depletion and non-attainment of equilibrium, distorting the calculation of K(d) and K(dA) . Strategies, both theoretical and practical, will be given to avoid and correct such errors, thus leading to the determination of reliable values for these constants. In determining K(dA) from competition binding studies, two additional concepts are discussed. First, the necessity to measure an adequate specific binding signal from the bound radiotracer ligand limits the range of affinity constants that can be measured: a particular set of assay conditions may lead to an upper limit on the apparent affinity of unlabelled ligands. Second, an extension of the basic assay methodology can indicate whether the interaction between the tracer and a test ligand is mediated by a competitive or an allosteric mechanism. Finally, the review ends with a discussion of two factors that are often overlooked: buffer composition and the temperature at which the assay is conducted, and the impact these can have on affinity measurements and the understanding of drug interactions.},

First, we evaluate the feasibility of two techniques for correcting for multiple comparisons: the single threshold test and a procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). To test these techniques, foci from four different topics within the literature were analyzed: overt speech in stuttering subjects, the color-word Stroop task, picture-naming tasks, and painful stimulation. In addition, the performance of each thresholding method was tested on randomly generated foci. We found that the FDR method more effectively controls the rate of false positives in meta-analyses of small or large numbers of foci. Second, we propose a technique for making statistical comparisons of ALE meta-analyses and investigate its efficacy on different groups of foci divided by task or response type and random groups of similarly obtained foci. We then give an example of how comparisons of this sort may lead to advanced designs in future meta-analytic research.},

Good agreement between the experiments and theory is demonstrated for most of the available range of experimental conditions, and the method is shown to be a good one for the determination of the rate of reaction of the enzyme and mediator. In the case where the enzyme substrate kinetics are rate limiting it is shown that the correct interpretation of the data is more difficult because of the effects of concentration polarization of the substrate. An approach to overcoming this problem is described. The experimental techniques and analysis described in this paper should be generally applicable to studies of the homogeneous kinetics of mediated enzyme reactions.},

abstract = {A new peak picking algorithm for the analysis of mass spectrometric (MS) data is presented. It is independent of the underlying machine or ionization method, and is able to resolve highly convoluted and asymmetric signals. The method uses the multiscale nature of spectrometric data by first detecting the mass peaks in the wavelet-transformed signal before a given asymmetric peak function is fitted to the raw data. In an optional third stage, the resulting fit can be further improved using techniques from nonlinear optimization. In contrast to currently established techniques (e.g. SNAP, Apex) our algorithm is able to separate overlapping peaks of multiply charged peptides in ESI-MS data of low resolution. Its improved accuracy with respect to peak positions makes it a valuable preprocessing method for MS-based identification and quantification experiments. The method has been validated on a number of different annotated test cases, where it compares favorably in both runtime and accuracy with currently established techniques. An implementation of the algorithm is freely available in our open source framework OpenMS.},

We developed a set of tailored quality control and normalization procedures based on ELISA validation to allow patient comparisons and determination of individual cutoffs for specificity and sensitivity. Sera from 60 patients with pancreatic cancer, 51 patients with ovarian cancer, and 53 age-matched healthy donors were used to assess the binding of IgG antibodies against a panel of {\textgreater}8000 human antigens using protein microarrays and fluorescence detection. The resulting data interpretation led to the definition and ranking of proteins with preferred recognition by the sera from cancer patients in comparison with healthy donors, both by frequency and strength of signal. We found that 202 proteins were preferentially immunogenic in ovarian cancer sera compared to 29 in pancreatic cancer, with few overlaps. Correlates of autoantibody signatures with known tumor expression of corresponding antigens, functional pathways, clinical stage, and outcome were examined. Serological analysis of arrays displaying the complete human proteome (seromics) represents a new era in cancer immunology, opening the way to defining the repertoire of the humoral immune response to cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) which recognize peptide epitopes of tumour or viral origin has been a major aim of immunotherapy research for the past decade. Alongside the established dendritic cell-based methods, more recent approaches using recombinant MHC class I peptide complexes have been developed. METHODS: In this study we have explored the potential of a simplified system using soluble streptavidin-linked MHC class I tetramers to expand antigen-specific CTLs in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro tetramer-mediated expansion of CD8+ CTLs recognizing HLA-2/Melan-A and HLA-A2/Gag complexes was demonstrated with PBMCs from healthy donors or HIV+ donors, respectively. With 3 weekly rounds of tetramer stimulation, cell numbers expanded 100-fold from 0.05 to 5.0{\%}. The lytic function of HLA-A2/Melan-A-expanded cells was demonstrated in 51Cr release assays by specific killing of T2 cells pulsed with Melan-A, but not other peptides. Similarly, murine CD8+ T cells specific for the HY epitope H2-Db/Uty could be expanded in vitro over a wide range of tetramer concentrations (0.008-1.0 microg/ml), with a single exposure producing substantial T cell expansion from 0.11 to 36{\%}. Intraperitoneal administration of H2-Db/Uty tetramers to primed C57BL/6 mice produced over 5-fold expansion of Db/Uty-specific CTL in vivo. CONCLUSION: The results in this paper demonstrate that simple, multimeric MHC complexes may be of value in expanding CTLs in vitro for adoptive immunotherapy and also potentially in vivo. Further studies will be necessary to clarify the optimum protocols and schedules of administration for T cell expansion using recombinant MHC multimers.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

@article{Molinaro2005,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In genomic studies, thousands of features are collected on relatively few samples. One of the goals of these studies is to build classifiers to predict the outcome of future observations. There are three inherent steps to this process: feature selection, model selection and prediction assessment. With a focus on prediction assessment, we compare several methods for estimating the 'true' prediction error of a prediction model in the presence of feature selection. RESULTS: For small studies where features are selected from thousands of candidates, the resubstitution and simple split-sample estimates are seriously biased. In these small samples, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and the .632+ bootstrap have the smallest bias for diagonal discriminant analysis, nearest neighbor and classification trees. LOOCV and 10-fold CV have the smallest bias for linear discriminant analysis. Additionally, LOOCV, 5- and 10-fold CV, and the .632+ bootstrap have the lowest mean square error. The .632+ bootstrap is quite biased in small sample sizes with strong signal-to-noise ratios. Differences in performance among resampling methods are reduced as the number of specimens available increase.

@article{Levenstien2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the increasing amount of data generated in molecular genetics laboratories, it is often difficult to make sense of results because of the vast number of different outcomes or variables studied. Examples include expression levels for large numbers of genes and haplotypes at large numbers of loci. It is then natural to group observations into smaller numbers of classes that allow for an easier overview and interpretation of the data. This grouping is often carried out in multiple steps with the aid of hierarchical cluster analysis, each step leading to a smaller number of classes by combining similar observations or classes. At each step, either implicitly or explicitly, researchers tend to interpret results and eventually focus on that set of classes providing the "best" (most significant) result. While this approach makes sense, the overall statistical significance of the experiment must include the clustering process, which modifies the grouping structure of the data and often removes variation. RESULTS: For hierarchically clustered data, we propose considering the strongest result or, equivalently, the smallest p-value as the experiment-wise statistic of interest and evaluating its significance level for a global assessment of statistical significance. We apply our approach to datasets from haplotype association and microarray expression studies where hierarchical clustering has been used. CONCLUSION: In all of the cases we examine, we find that relying on one set of classes in the course of clustering leads to significance levels that are too small when compared with the significance level associated with an overall statistic that incorporates the process of clustering. In other words, relying on one step of clustering may furnish a formally significant result while the overall experiment is not significant.},

abstract = {Metastatic spread of cancer through the lymphatic system affects hundreds of thousands of patients yearly. Growth of new lymphatic vessels, lymphangiogenesis, is activated in cancer and inflammation, but is largely inactive in normal physiology, and therefore offers therapeutic potential. Key mediators of lymphangiogenesis have been identified in developmental studies. During embryonic development, lymphatic endothelial cells derive from the blood vascular endothelium and differentiate under the guidance of lymphatic-specific regulators, such as the prospero homeobox 1 transcription factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and VEGF receptor 3 signaling are essential for the further development of lymphatic vessels and therefore they provide a promising target for inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis. Lymphangiogenesis is important for the progression of solid tumors as shown for melanoma and breast cancer. Tumor cells may use chemokine gradients as guidance cues and enter lymphatic vessels through intercellular openings between endothelial cell junctions or, possibly, by inducing larger discontinuities in the endothelial cell layer. Tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes show enhanced lymphangiogenesis even before cancer metastasis and they may function as a permissive 'lymphovascular niche' for the survival of metastatic cells. Although our current knowledge indicates that the development of anti-lymphangiogenic therapies may be beneficial for the treatment of cancer patients, several open questions remain with regard to the frequency, mechanisms and biological importance of lymphatic metastases.},

abstract = {Immunogenic peptides of human tumor Ag have been used to generate antigen-specific CTL. However, the vast majority of these peptide-specific CTL clones are of low avidity and are peptide, but not tumor, reactive. Peptide-MHC tetramers have been shown to bind specific TCRs with sufficient affinity to be useful reagents for flow cytometry. In this paper we demonstrate that peptide-MHC tetramers can also be used to selectively identify high avidity tumor-reactive CTL and enrich, from a heterogeneous population, the subpopulation of peptide-reactive T cells that can lyse tumor targets. The melanoma proteins, MART-1 and gp100, were used to induce potentially tumor-reactive T cells, and the intensity of T cell staining by TCR binding of specific peptide-MHC tetramers was assessed. A range of fluorescence intensity was detected, and the magnitude of tetramer binding was correlated with T cell avidity. The population of peptide-reactive T cells was phenotypically similar with regard to expression of TCR and adhesion molecules, suggesting that this differential avidity for tumor cells reflected differential affinity of the TCR for its peptide-MHC ligand. Sorting, cloning, and expansion of tetramerhigh CTL from a heterogeneous population of peptide-stimulated PBMCs enabled rapid selection of high avidity tumor-reactive CTL clones, which retained their functional and tetramerhigh phenotype on re-expansion. These results demonstrate that the avidity of a T cell for its tumor target is due to the specific affinity of the TCR for its peptide-MHC ligand, that this interaction can be described using peptide-MHC tetramers and used to isolate high avidity tumor-reactive CTL.},

Chemotherapeutic agents, by compromising, to some extent, the intestinal integrity, increase the gut permeability and selective translocation of Gram-positive bacteria in secondary lymphoid organs. There, anticommensal pathogenic Th17 T-cell responses are primed, facilitating the accumulation of Th1 helper T cells in tumor beds after chemotherapy as well as tumor regression. Importantly, the redox equilibrium of myeloid cells contained in the tumor microenvironment is also influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Hence, the anticancer efficacy of alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide) and platinum salts (oxaliplatin, cis-platin) is compromised in germ-free mice or animals treated with antibiotics. These findings represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the mode of action of many compounds having an impact on the host-microbe mutualism.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 16 May 2014; doi:10.1038/cdd.2014.56.},

Recent applications include the study of autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As sequencing technologies continue to improve, these repertoire sequencing experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of sequences. These data require specialized bioinformatics pipelines to be analyzed effectively. Numerous methods and tools have been developed to handle different steps of the analysis, and integrated software suites have recently been made available. However, the field has yet to converge on a standard pipeline for data processing and analysis. Common file formats for data sharing are also lacking. Here we provide a set of practical guidelines for B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing analysis, starting from raw sequencing reads and proceeding through pre-processing, determination of population structure, and analysis of repertoire properties. These include methods for unique molecular identifiers and sequencing error correction, V(D)J assignment and detection of novel alleles, clonal assignment, lineage tree construction, somatic hypermutation modeling, selection analysis, and analysis of stereotyped or convergent responses. The guidelines presented here highlight the major steps involved in the analysis of B-cell repertoire sequencing data, along with recommendations on how to avoid common pitfalls.},

Although fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, where single molecules can readily be detected, there is still a drive for reduced detection limits. The detection of a fluorophore is usually limited by its quantum yield, autofluorescence of the samples and/or the photostability of the fluorophores; however, there has been a recent explosion in the use of metallic nanostructures to favorably modify the spectral properties of fluorophores and to alleviate some of these fluorophore photophysical constraints.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods for extracting useful information from the datasets produced by microarray experiments are at present of much interest. Here we present new methods for finding gene sets that are well suited for distinguishing experiment classes, such as healthy versus diseased tissues. Our methods are based on evaluating genes in pairs and evaluating how well a pair in combination distinguishes two experiment classes. We tested the ability of our pair-based methods to select gene sets that generalize the differences between experiment classes and compared the performance relative to two standard methods. To assess the ability to generalize class differences, we studied how well the gene sets we select are suited for learning a classifier. RESULTS: We show that the gene sets selected by our methods outperform the standard methods, in some cases by a large margin, in terms of cross-validation prediction accuracy of the learned classifier. We show that on two public datasets, accurate diagnoses can be made using only 15-30 genes. Our results have implications for how to select marker genes and how many gene measurements are needed for diagnostic purposes. CONCLUSION: When looking for differential expression between experiment classes, it may not be sufficient to look at each gene in a separate universe. Evaluating combinations of genes reveals interesting information that will not be discovered otherwise. Our results show that class prediction can be improved by taking advantage of this extra information.},

To emphasize depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and patient details. Combination of almost 20 000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of mutations and biomarkers across cancer patient populations. Conversely, our curation of cancer genomes (over 12 000) emphasizes knowledge breadth, driving discovery of unrecognized cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. In addition, COSMIC also details more than six million noncoding mutations, 10 534 gene fusions, 61 299 genome rearrangements, 695 504 abnormal copy number segments and 60 119 787 abnormal expression variants. All these types of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and mutation types.},

abstract = {Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

This article concerns the connection between the two theories. A Rao-Blackwell type of relation is derived in which nonparametric methods such as cross-validation are seen to be randomized versions of their covariance penalty counterparts.

The emerging science of cancer markers also demands for the new sensitive detection methods. In this work, we have developed an electrochemical immunosensor for antigen MUC16 using gold nanoelectrode ensemble (GNEE) and ferrocene carboxylic acid encapsulated liposomes tethered with monoclonal anti-Mucin-16 antibodies ($\alpha$MUC16). GNEEs were fabricated by electroless deposition of the gold within the pores of polycarbonate track-etched membranes. Afterwards, $\alpha$MUC16 were immobilized on preformed self-assembled monolayer of cysteamine on the GNEE via cross-linking with EDC-Sulfo-NHS. A sandwich immunoassay was performed on $\alpha$MUC16 functionalized GNEE with MUC16 and immunoliposomes. The differential pulse voltammetry was employed to quantify the faradic redox response of ferrocene carboxylic acid released from immunoliposomes. The dose-response curve for MUC16 concentration was found between the range of 0.001-300 U mL(-1). The lowest detection limit was found to be 5×10(-4) U mL(-1) (S/N=3). We evaluated the performance of this developed immunosensor with commercial ELISA assay by comparing results obtained from spiked serum samples and real blood serum samples from volunteers.},

abstract = {Here we demonstrated an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunoassay employing graphene, platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), glucose oxidase (GOD) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as enhancers to simultaneously detect carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This immunosensor is based on the observation that multiple-labeled antibodies (thionine-labeled anti-CEA and ferrocene-labeled anti-AFP) recognition event yielded a distinct voltammetric peak through "sandwich" immunoreaction, whose position and size reflected the identity and level of the corresponding antigen. Greatly enhanced sensitivity for cancer markers is based on a triple signal amplification strategy. Experimental results revealed that the immunoassay enabled simultaneous determination of CEA and AFP in a single run with wide working ranges of 0.01-100 ng mL(-1). The detection limits reached 1.64 pg mL(-1) for CEA and 1.33 pg mL(-1) for AFP. No obvious cross-talk was observed during the experiment. In addition, through the analysis of clinical serum samples, the proposed method received a good correlation with ELISA as a reference. The signal amplification strategy could be easily modified and extended to detect other multiple targets.},

The immune system appears to be capable of sensing aberrant structure, distribution, and function of certain cellular components involved in tumorigenesis and making autoantibody responses to the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Autoantibodies to TAAs can report malignant transformation before standard clinical studies and may be useful as early detection biomarkers. The autoantibody response also provides insights into factors related to how cellular components may be rendered immunogenic. As diagnostic biomarkers, specific TAA miniarrays for identifying autoantibody profiles could have sufficient sensitivity in differentiating between types of tumors. Such anti-TAA profiles could also be used to monitor response to therapy. The immune system of cancer patients reveals the immune interactive sites or the autoepitopes of participants in tumorigenesis, and this information should be used in the design of immunotherapy.},

abstract = {It is well-known, but frequently overlooked, that low- and high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e., systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a biologically significant finding. An integral step toward reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two sources of batch effects: row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function, ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In the "initial analysis," the application of ComBat to an unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant (FDR {\textless} 0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a "revised processing" included changes to our analysis as well as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports conclusions made by an article previously published in this journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve as a reminder to the broader community to establish research questions a priori, ensure that they match with study design and encourage communication between technicians and analysts.},

abstract = {It is quite clear that B-cell epitopes on intact, native protein antigens in solution are of the discontinuous type whether defined structurally or functionally. It is also clear that although B-cell epitopes share a number of common features, they can only be defined in detail in terms of the individual antibody with which they react and in terms of the method used to describe them. Therefore, in order to ensure open communication and eliminate misunderstanding between individual investigators, it is wise to clearly state the conditions under which the epitope is defined. Given these conditions, one can view protein antigenicity in terms of the multideterminant, regulatory hypothesis presented some years ago. This hypothesis states that "The surface of a protein consists of a complex array of overlapping potential antigenic determinants; in aggregate these approach a continuum. Most determinants depend upon the conformational integrity of the native molecule. Those to which an individual responds are dictated by the structural differences between the antigen and the host's self-proteins and by host regulatory mechanisms, and are not necessarily an inherent property of the protein molecule reflecting restricted antigenicity or limited antigenic sites".},

abstract = {Problems involving dependent pairs of varia- bles (X, Y) have been studied most intensively in the case of bivariate normal distributions and of 2 X 2 tables. This is due primarily to the importance of these cases but perhaps partly also to the fact that they exhibit only a particularly simple form of dependence. (See Examples 9(i) and 10 in Section 7.) Studies in- volving the general case center mainly around two problems: (i) tests of inde- pendence; (ii) definition and estimation of measures of association. In most treatments of these problems, there occurs implicitly a concept which is of im- portance also in other contexts (for example, the evaluation of the performance of certain multiple decision procedures), the concept of positive (or negative) de- pendence or association. Tests of independence, for example those based on rank correlation, Kendall's t-statistic, or normal scores, are usually not omnibus tests (for a discussion of such tests see [4], [15] and [17], but designed to detect rather specific types of alternatives, namely those for which large values of Y tend to be associated with large values of X and small values of Y with small values of X (positive dependence) or the opposite case of negative dependence in which large values of one variable tend to be associated with small values of the other. Simi- larly, measures of association are typically designed to measure the degree of this kind of association. The purpose of the present paper is to give three successively stronger defi- nitions of positive dependence, to investigate their consequences, explore the strength of each definition through a number of examples, and to give some statistical applications. 2.},

abstract = {Flavonoids constitute the largest class of dietary phytochemicals, adding essential health value to our diet, and are emerging as key nutraceuticals. Cellular targets for dietary phytochemicals remain largely unknown, posing significant challenges for the regulation of dietary supplements and the understanding of how nutraceuticals provide health value. Here, we describe the identification of human cellular targets of apigenin, a flavonoid abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, using an innovative high-throughput approach that combines phage display with second generation sequencing. The 160 identified high-confidence candidate apigenin targets are significantly enriched in three main functional categories: GTPase activation, membrane transport, and mRNA metabolism/alternative splicing. This last category includes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNPA2), a factor involved in splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and mRNA transport. Apigenin binds to the C-terminal glycine-rich domain of hnRNPA2, preventing hnRNPA2 from forming homodimers, and therefore, it perturbs the alternative splicing of several human hnRNPA2 targets. Our results provide a framework to understand how dietary phytochemicals exert their actions by binding to many functionally diverse cellular targets. In turn, some of them may modulate the activity of a large number of downstream genes, which is exemplified here by the effects of apigenin on the alternative splicing activity of hnRNPA2. Hence, in contrast to small-molecule pharmaceuticals designed for defined target specificity, dietary phytochemicals affect a large number of cellular targets with varied affinities that, combined, result in their recognized health benefits.},

abstract = {Most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from progressive disease after relapse, which is associated with clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.},

Results from experimental sets designed to identify potential causes (from microarray production to array scanning) indicated that the anomaly was linked to a batch process; further work allowed us to localize the effect to the posthybridization array stringency washes. Ozone levels were monitored and highly correlated with the batch effect. Controlled exposures of microarrays to ozone confirmed this factor as the root cause, and we present data that show susceptibility of a class of cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy5, Alexa 647) to ozone levels as low as 5-10 ppb for periods as short as 10-30 s. Other cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy3, Alexa 555) were not significantly affected until higher ozone levels ({\textgreater} 100 ppb). To address this environmental effect, laboratory ozone levels should be kept below 2 ppb (e.g., with filters in HVAC) to achieve high quality microarray data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present approach to cancer treatment is often referred to as "trial and error" or "one size fits all." This practice is inefficient and frequently results in inappropriate therapy and treatment-related toxicity. In contrast, personalized treatment has the potential to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity. CONTENT: We reviewed the literature relevant to prognostic, predictive, and toxicity-related markers in cancer, with particular attention to systematic reviews, prospective randomized trials, and guidelines issued by expert panels. To achieve personalized treatment for cancer, we need markers for determining prognosis, predicting response to therapy, and predicting severe toxicity related to treatment. Among the best-validated prognostic markers currently available are serum concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for patients with nonseminoma germ cell tumors and tissue concentrations of both urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) for breast cancer patients. Clinically useful therapy predictive markers are estrogen and progesterone receptors to select patients with breast cancer for treatment with endocrine therapy and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) to select breast cancer patients for treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin). Markers available for identifying drug-induced adverse reactions include thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to predict toxicity from thiopurines in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase to predict toxicity from irinotecan in the treatment of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Validated prognostic, predictive, and toxicity markers should help cancer treatment move from the current trial-and-error approach to more personalized treatment.},

@article{Reiner2003,
abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multi-plicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR con-trolling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the nave application of the linear step-up procedure in Ben-jamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation. Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the nave one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDR control. Availability: An R program that adjusts p-values using FDR controlling procedures is freely available over the Internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/∼ybenja.},

abstract = {Motivation It is well known that batch effects exist in RNA-seq data and other profiling data. Although some methods do a good job adjusting for batch effects by modifying the data matrices, it is still difficult to remove the batch effects entirely. The remaining batch effect can cause artifacts in the detection of patterns in the data. Results In this study, we consider the batch effect issue in the pattern detection among the samples, such as clustering, dimension reduction, and construction of networks between subjects. Instead of adjusting the original data matrices, we design an adaptive method to directly adjust the dissimilarity matrix between samples. In simulation studies, the method achieved better results recovering true underlying clusters, compared to the leading batch effect adjustment method ComBat. In real data analysis, the method effectively corrected distance matrices, and improved the performance of clustering algorithms.

Particulates can elicit potent immune responses, either by direct immuno-stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APC) or/and by delivering antigen to specific cellular compartments and promoting antigen uptake by appropriate stimulatory cell types. Herein, we describe a detailed method for the preparation of a novel nanoparticle-based antigen delivery system which induces strong cellular and humoral immune responses in mice and sheep. This simple system is based on the use of 40 nanometer (nm) inert solid carrier beads to which antigen is covalently coupled before injection. Covalent conjugation of antigen to the nanobeads, assessment of conjugation efficiency, characterisation and measurement of in vivo immunogenicity by cytokine ELISPOT (to measure antigen-specific T-cell responses) and ELISA (to measure antibody titers), are described. Emphasis is placed on providing trouble-shooting advice to enable the reproducible production of soluble nano-size formulations that do not suffer from common problems such as aggregation, as well as understanding the causes and thus avoiding a range of prevalent technical problems that occur when using immune response detection assays, such as the cytokine ELISPOT assay and ELISA.},

abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the {\$}p{\$}-values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among pregnant women. In clinical settings blood-based testing protocols are commonly used to diagnose HEV infection, but in community settings such invasive sampling can hinder study participation and limit discovery of the ecology and natural history of HEV infection. Oral fluid is a non-invasive biospecimen that can harbor pathogen-specific antibodies and has the potential to replace blood-based testing protocols. 

OBJECTIVES
To develop an immunoassay to assess past and recent HEV infection that uses oral fluid instead of serum or plasma. 

METHODS
The assay was validated using paired oral fluid and serum samples collected from 141 patients who presented either with (n=76) or without (n=65) symptoms of acute viral hepatitis at a clinical diagnostics center in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV IgG (past HEV infection) and HEV IgA (recent HEV infection) antibodies was calculated in reference to Wantai's (Beijing Wantai) serum-based HEV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. 

RESULTS
The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV-IgG antibodies were 98.7{\%} and 98.4{\%}, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV IgA were 89.5{\%} and 98.3{\%}, respectively. 

CONCLUSIONS
The high concordance of our non-invasive oral fluid-based immunoassays (HEV IgG and HEV IgA) with commercial high-performance serum HEV ELISA kits (IgG and IgM) means that population-based surveillance of past and recent HEV infection could be expanded to improve understanding of its ecology and natural history.},

abstract = {The ability to detect single protein molecules in blood could accelerate the discovery and use of more sensitive diagnostic biomarkers. To detect low-abundance proteins in blood, we captured them on microscopic beads decorated with specific antibodies and then labeled the immunocomplexes (one or zero labeled target protein molecules per bead) with an enzymatic reporter capable of generating a fluorescent product. After isolating the beads in 50-fl reaction chambers designed to hold only a single bead, we used fluorescence imaging to detect single protein molecules. Our single-molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (digital ELISA) approach detected as few as approximately 10-20 enzyme-labeled complexes in 100 microl of sample (approximately 10(-19) M) and routinely allowed detection of clinically relevant proteins in serum at concentrations ({\textless}10(-15) M) much lower than conventional ELISA. Digital ELISA detected prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in sera from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy at concentrations as low as 14 fg/ml (0.4 fM).},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Discrimination between two classes such as normal and cancer samples and between two types of cancers based on gene expression profiles is an important problem which has practical implications as well as the potential to further our understanding of gene expression of various cancer cells. Classification or discrimination of more than two groups or classes (multi-class) is also needed. The need for multi-class discrimination methodologies is apparent in many microarray experiments where various cancer types are considered simultaneously. RESULTS: Thus, in this paper we present the extension to the classification methodology proposed earlier Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50) to classify cancer samples from multiple classes. The methodologies proposed in this paper are applied to four gene expression data sets with multiple classes: (a) a hereditary breast cancer data set with (1) BRCA1-mutation, (2) BRCA2-mutation and (3) sporadic breast cancer samples, (b) an acute leukemia data set with (1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and (3) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples, (c) a lymphoma data set with (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and (3) follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, and (d) the NCI60 data set with cell lines derived from cancers of various sites of origin. In addition, we evaluated the classification algorithms and examined the variability of the error rates using simulations based on randomization of the real data sets. We note that there are other methods for addressing multi-class prediction recently and our approach is along the line of Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50).

abstract = {Fast digital imaging was used to study the deformation and poration of giant unilamellar vesicles subjected to electric pulses. For the first time the dynamics of response and relaxation of the membrane at micron-scale level is revealed at a time resolution of 30 micros. Above a critical transmembrane potential the lipid bilayer ruptures. Formation of macropores (diameter approximately 2 microm) with pore lifetime of approximately 10 ms has been detected. The pore lifetime has been interpreted as interplay between the pore edge tension and the membrane viscosity. The reported data, covering six decades of time, show the following regimes in the relaxation dynamics of the membrane. Tensed vesicles first relax to release the acquired stress due to stretching, approximately 100 micros. In the case of poration, membrane resealing occurs with a characteristic time of approximately 10 ms. Finally, for vesicles with excess area an additional slow regime was observed, approximately 1 s, which we associate with relaxation of membrane curvature. Dimensional analysis can reasonably well explain the corresponding characteristic timescales. Being performed on cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles, this study brings insight to cell electroporation. The latter is widely used for gene transfection and drug transport across the membrane where processes occurring at different timescales may influence the efficiency.},

However current proteomic techniques produce high volumes of information that are dispersed over several online databases. Collecting all of this data and using an integrative approach capable of identifying unknown associations is still an unsolved problem. This is the main motivation for this work. Results: We present the online bioinformatic tool OralCard, which comprises results from 55 manually curated articles reflecting the oral molecular ecosystem (OralPhysiOme). It comprises experimental information available from the oral proteome both of human (OralOme) and microbial origin (MicroOralOme) structured in protein, disease and organism. Conclusions: This tool is a key resource for researchers to understand the molecular foundations implicated in biology and disease mechanisms of the oral cavity. The usefulness of this tool is illustrated with the analysis of the oral proteome associated with diabetes melitus type 2.

abstract = {A novel electrochemical immunosensor based on double signal amplification of enzyme-encapsulated liposomes and biocatalytic metal deposition was developed for the detection of human prostate specific antigen (PSA). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-encapsulated and detection antibody-functionalized liposomes were first prepared and used as the detection reagent. In the sandwich immunoassay, the model analyte PSA was first captured by anti-PSA capture antibody immobilized on the electrode and then sandwiched with the functionalized liposomes. The bound liposomes were then lysed with surfactant to release the encapsulated ALP, which served as secondary signal amplification means. ALP on the electrode surface initiated the hydrolysis of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-p) to produce ascorbic acid. The latter, in turn, reduced silver ions on the electrode surface, leading to deposition of the metal silver on the electrode surface. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was chosen to detect the amount of the deposited silver. The results showed that the anodic stripping peak current was linearly dependent on the PSA concentration in the range of 0.01-100 ng mL(-1), and a detection limit as low as 0.007 ng mL(-1) can be obtained. Since the cut-off value of human PSA is 4 ng mL(-1), the proposed electrochemical immunosensor would be expected to gain widespread applications for the detection of PSA in clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are well-known techniques for feature extraction from two sets of multi- dimensional variables. The fundamental difference between CCA and PLS is that CCA maximizes the correlation while PLS maximizes the covariance. Although both CCA and PLS have been applied successfully in various applications, the intrinsic relationship between them remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by showing the equivalence relationship between CCA and or- thonormalized partial least squares (OPLS), a vari- ant of PLS. We further extend the equivalence re- lationship to the case when regularization is em- ployed for both sets of variables. In addition, we show that the CCA projection for one set of vari- ables is independent of the regularization on the other set of variables. We have performed exper- imental studies using both synthetic and real data sets and our results confirm the established equiva- lence relationship. The presented analysis provides novel insights into the connection between these two existing algorithms as well as the effect of the regularization.},

The correct use and interpretation of antibody microarray data requires proper normalization of the data, which has not yet been systematically studied. Therefore we undertook a study to determine the optimal normalization of data from antibody microarray profiling of proteins in human serum specimens. Forty-three serum samples collected from patients with pancreatic cancer and from control subjects were probed in triplicate on microarrays containing 48 different antibodies, using a direct labeling, two-color comparative fluorescence detection format. Seven different normalization methods representing major classes of normalization for antibody microarray data were compared by their effects on reproducibility, accuracy, and trends in the data set. Normalization with ELISA-determined concentrations of IgM resulted in the most accurate, reproducible, and reliable data. The other normalization methods were deficient in at least one of the criteria. Multiparametric classification of the samples based on the combined measurement of seven of the proteins demonstrated the potential for increased classification accuracy compared with the use of individual measurements. This study establishes reliable normalization for antibody microarray data, criteria for assessing normalization performance, and the capability of antibody microarrays for serum-protein profiling and multiparametric sample classification.},

To objectively uncover cellular heterogeneity from single-cell measurements, we present a versatile computational approach, spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE). We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases, SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers. SPADE facilitates the analysis of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of cell types and comparison of functional markers in response to perturbations.},

abstract = {We describe a novel method for the differential analysis of RNA-Seq data that utilizes bootstrapping in conjunction with response error linear modeling to decouple biological variance from inferential variance. The method is implemented in an interactive shiny app called sleuth that utilizes kallisto quantifications and bootstraps for fast and accurate analysis of RNA-Seq experiments.},

abstract = {Background: There is longstanding evidence for the diagnostic potential of single autoantibodies for cancer and other diseases and more recently for the potential of complex autoantibody signatures. Here we address the question whether cancer specific signatures exist. Methods: We analysed our autoantibody screening data both newly and previously generated using a single array platform with 1827 identified immunogenic clones. These clones were tested for their reactivity against a total of 428 human sera including 191 sera of patients with different cancer entities, 60 sera of healthy individuals and 177 sera of patients with non-cancer diseases by using bioinformatics approaches. Results: Principal Component Analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed significant differences between the three cohorts. Evaluating the autoantibody reactivities in the three groups using Support Vector Machines, we were able to separate cancer sera from normal sera with an accuracy of 94.08{\%}. A pathway analysis that was based on antigens with an increased reactivity in patients' sera as compared to controls indicated glycolysis as central pathway. The separation between cancer and non-cancer disease sera was possible with an accuracy of only 69.58{\%}, which is still significantly higher than by random classification. Conclusion: As for single autoantigens, we show that proteins that are frequently reactive with cancer sera are also frequently reactive with non-cancer sera. While these results underline the potential of autoantibody signatures for cancer diagnosis, they also caution to premature claim specificity of a signature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore MinION are capable of producing long sequencing reads with average fragment lengths of over 10,000 base-pairs and maximum lengths reaching 100,000 base- pairs. Compared with short reads, the assemblies obtained from long-read sequencing platforms have much higher contig continuity and genome completeness as long fragments are able to extend paths into problematic or repetitive regions. Many successful assembly applications of the Pacific Biosciences technology have been reported ranging from small bacterial genomes to large plant and animal genomes. Recently, genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore MinION data have attracted much attention due to the portability and low cost of this novel sequencing instrument. In this paper, we re-sequenced a well characterized genome, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain using three different platforms: MinION, PacBio and MiSeq. We present a comprehensive metric comparison of assemblies generated by various pipelines and discuss how the platform associated data characteristics affect the assembly quality. With a given read depth of 31X, the assemblies from both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore MinION show excellent continuity and completeness for the 16 nuclear chromosomes, but not for the mitochondrial genome, whose reconstruction still represents a significant challenge.},

abstract = {Transgenic Balb/c mice expressing the transforming rat HER-2/neu oncogene develop early and multifocal mammary carcinomas. Within the first 5 months of life the tissue-specific expression of HER-2/neu causes a progression in all their 10 mammary glands from atypical hyperplasia to invasive carcinoma. It was previously observed that chronic administration of interleukin (IL)-12 increased tumor latency, but every mouse eventually succumbed to multiple carcinomas. A significant improvement in tumor prevention was sought by administering allogeneic mammary carcinoma cells expressing HER-2/neu combined with systemic IL-12. This treatment reduced tumor incidence by 90{\%} and more than doubled mouse lifetime. For the maximum prevention p185neu antigen must be expressed by allogeneic cells. IL-12 treatment strongly increased the cell vaccine efficacy. The mammary glands of mice receiving the combined treatment displayed a markedly reduced epithelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and HER-2/neu expression, while the few hyperplastic foci were heavily infiltrated by granulocytes, macrophages, and CD8+ lymphocytes. Specific anti–HER-2/neu antibodies were produced and a nonpolarized activation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells secreting IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ were evident. A central role for IFN-$\gamma$ in the preventive effect was proven by the lack of efficacy of vaccination in IFN-$\gamma$ gene knockout HER-2/neu transgenic Balb/c mice. A possible requirement for IFN-$\gamma$ is related to its effect on antibody production, in particular on IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses, that were not induced in IFN-$\gamma$ knockout HER-2/neu mice. In conclusion, our data show that an allogeneic HER-2/neu–expressing cell vaccine combined with IL-12 systemic treatment can prevent the onset of genetically determined tumors. },

abstract = {Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in immunocompromised recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a cause of morbidity and mortality from viral pneumonitis. Antiviral drugs given to reactivating patients have reduced the mortality from CMV but have toxic side effects and do not always prevent late CMV disease. Cellular immunotherapy to prevent CMV disease is less toxic and could provide prolonged protection. However, a practical approach to generating sufficient quantities of CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is required. This study describes a system for generating sufficient CMV-specific CTLs for adoptive immunotherapy of HLA-A*0201 bone marrow transplant recipients from 200 mL donor blood. Donor monocytes are used to generate dendritic cells (DCs) in medium with autologous plasma, interleukin 4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and CD40 ligand. The DCs are pulsed with the immunodominant HLA-A*0201-restricted CMV peptide pp65(495-503), and incubated with donor T cells. These cultures are restimulated twice with peptide-pulsed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) or CD40-ligated B cells and purified with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled pp65(495-503)/HLA-A*0201 tetramers by flow sorting, or with anti-PE paramagnetic beads. The pure tetramer-positive population is then rapidly expanded to obtain sufficient cells for clinical immunotherapy. The expanded CTLs are more than 80{\%} pure, of memory phenotype, with a Tc1 cytokine profile. They efficiently kill CMV-infected fibroblasts and express the integrin VLA-4, suggesting that the CTLs could cross endothelial barriers. This technique is reproducible and could be used for generating CMV-specific CTLs to prevent CMV disease after allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation. (Blood. 2001;98:505-512)},

abstract = {Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a method for analysing gene expression data with a focus on a priori defined gene sets. The permutation test generally used in GSEA for testing the significance of gene set enrichment involves permutation of a phenotype vector and is developed for data from an indirect comparison design, i.e. unpaired data. In some studies the samples representing two phenotypes are paired, e.g. samples taken from a patient before and after treatment, or if samples representing two phenotypes are hybridised to the same two-channel array (direct comparison design). In this paper we will focus on data from direct comparison experiments, but the methods can be applied to paired data in general. For these types of data, a standard permutation test for paired data that randomly re-signs samples can be used. However, if the sample size is very small, which is often the case for a direct comparison design, a permutation test will give very imprecise estimates of the p-values. Here we propose using a rotation test rather than a permutation test for estimation of significance in GSEA of direct comparison data with a limited number of samples. Our proposed rotation test makes GSEA applicable to direct comparison data with few samples, by depending on rotations of the data instead of permutations. The rotation test is a generalisation of the permutation test, and can in addition be used on indirect comparison data and for testing significance of other types of test statistics outside the GSEA framework.},

abstract = {Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), favours the differentiation of T helper 1 (T(H)1) cells and forms a link between innate resistance and adaptive immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytes produce IL-12 in response to pathogens during infection. Production of IL-12 is dependent on differential mechanisms of regulation of expression of the genes encoding IL-12, patterns of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and cross-regulation between the different DC subsets, involving cytokines such as IL-10 and type I IFN. Recent data, however, argue against an absolute requirement for IL-12 for T(H)1 responses. Our understanding of the relative roles of IL-12 and other factors in T(H)1-type maturation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is discussed here, including the participation in this process of IL-23 and IL-27, two recently discovered members of the new family of heterodimeric cytokines.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

An amperometric immunosensor exploiting enzyme encapsulating thermosensitive liposomes for the ultrasensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is reported. Five different bioconjugation methods to link an anti-CEA antibody to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encapsulating liposomes were studied and compared to HRP-Ab conjugate. $\zeta$-Potential measurements of liposomes before and after each modification method as well as following incubation with CEA were used as a tool to monitor the success of modification and probe the affinity of the liposome linked antibodies. The use of different lysing conditions (temperature vs detergent) was evaluated, with the application of temperature providing an extremely effective means of liposome lysis. Finally, thermosensitive liposomes modified using biotin-streptavidin and N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA)/sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC) chemistries were used to detect CEA and compared in terms of their stability, background signal, and limit of detection. Detection limits of 2 orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with the HRP-antibody reporter conjugate were obtained (0.080 ng CEA/mL and 0.0113 ng CEA/mL), with 11-fold and 9-fold amplification of signal, for the biotin-streptavidin and SATA/Sulfo-SMCC modified liposomes respectively, clearly demonstrating the powerful potential of enzyme encapsulating liposomes as signal enhancement tools.},

abstract = {Background: Schmallenberg virus (SBV), discovered in continental Europe in late 2011, causes mild clinical signs in adult ruminants, including diarrhoea and reduced milk yield. However, fetal infection can lead to severe malformation in newborn offspring. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are commercially available for detection of SBV-specific antibodies in bovine sera and milk. Here we describe the development and evaluation of an indirect ELISA based on a yeast derived recombinant SBV nucleocapsid protein (N) for the detection of SBV-specific antibodies in bovine saliva. Development of a non-invasive test to detect antibodies in individual bovine saliva samples could potentially provide a test suitable for calves and adult cattle. The aim of this study was to investigate the agreement between the levels of antibodies (IgG) measured in milk and sera, and the level of antibodies (IgG and IgA) in saliva, in comparison with the antibody levels detected in sera and milk with commercially available test. Results: Serum, milk and saliva samples from 58 cows were collected from three dairy herds in Lithuania and tested for the presence of SBV-specific antibodies. The presence of IgG antibodies was tested in parallel serum and milk samples, while the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies was tested in saliva samples. The presence of SBV-specific IgG and IgA in saliva was tested using an indirect ELISA based on a yeast-derived recombinant N protein. The presence of SBV-specific IgG in milk and sera was tested in parallel using a commercial recombinant protein based test. The sensitivities of the newly developed tests were as follows: 96 {\%} for the IgG serum assay and 94 {\%} for the IgG milk assay and 85 {\%} and 98 {\%} for IgG and IgA in saliva tests, when compared with data generated by a commercial IgG assay. Conclusions: Data from testing the saliva IgG and IgA and also the milk and serum IgG with indirect SBV-specific ELISAs showed close agreement with the commercial serum and milk IgG assay data. The level of IgG in saliva was notably lower in comparison to IgA. The newly developed method exhibits the potential to serve as an easily transferable tool for epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {The influence of geometry of silica nanomaterials on cellular uptake and toxicity on epithelial and phagocytic cells was studied. Three types of amine-terminated silica nanomaterials were prepared and characterized via the modified Stober method, namely spheres (178±27 nm), worms (232±22 nm×1348±314 nm) and cylinders (214±29 nm×428±66 nm). The findings of the study suggest that in this size range and for the cell types studied, geometry does not play a dominant role in the modes of toxicity and uptake of these particles. Rather, a concentration threshold and cell type dependent toxicity of all particle types was observed. This correlated with confocal microscopy observations, as all nanomaterials were observed to be taken up in both cell types, with a greater extent in phagocytic cells. It must be noted that there appears to be a concentration threshold at {\~{}}100 $\mu$g/mL, below which there is limited to no impact of the nanoparticles on membrane integrity, mitochondrial function, phagocytosis or cell death. Analysis of cell morphology by transmission electron microscopy, colocalization experiments with intracellular markers and Western Blot results provide evidence of potential involvement of lysosomal escape, autophagic like activity, compartmental fusion and recycling in response to intracellular nanoparticle accumulation. These processes could be involved in cellular coping or defense mechanisms. The manipulation of physicochemical properties to enhance or reduce toxicity paves the way for the safe design of silica-based nanoparticles for use in nanomedicine.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties which make them promising platforms for drug delivery. However, immune cells in the bloodstream (such as monocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and dendritic cells) and in tissues (such as resident phagocytes) have a propensity to engulf and eliminate certain nanoparticles. A nanoparticle's interaction with plasma proteins (opsonins) and blood components (via hemolysis, thrombogenicity and complement activation) may influence uptake and clearance and hence potentially affect distribution and delivery to the intended target sites. Nanoparticle uptake by the immune cells is influenced by many factors. Different nanoparticles have been shown to act on different pathways, while various characteristics/properties also affect which pathway is employed for particle internalization. Nanoparticle protein binding occurs almost instantaneously once the particle enters biological medium, and the physical properties of such a particle-protein complex are often different than those of the formulated particle. These new properties can contribute to different biological responses and change nanoparticle biodistribution. Therefore, in the situation when specific delivery to immune cells is not desired, the ideal nanoparticle platform is the one whose integrity is not disturbed in the complex biological environment, which provides extended circulation in the blood to maximize delivery to the target site, is not toxic to blood cellular components, and is "invisible" to the immune cells which can remove it from circulation. This review discusses the most recent data on nanoparticle interactions with blood components and how particle size and surface charge define their hematocompatibility. This includes properties which determine particle interaction with plasma proteins and uptake by macrophages. We will also provide an overview of in vitro methods useful in identifying interactions with components of the immune system and the potential effects of such interaction on particle distribution to tissues.},

The advantages of the new method were speed and sim- plicity of operation. The feasibility of the idea was demonstrated by the synthesis of the model tetrapeptide L-leucyl-L-alanylglycyl-L-valine.

abstract = {CONTEXT: MicroRNAs have potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. No study has evaluated the association between microRNA expression patterns and colon cancer prognosis or therapeutic outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify microRNA expression patterns associated with colon adenocarcinomas, prognosis, or therapeutic outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: MicroRNA microarray expression profiling of tumors and paired nontumorous tissues was performed on a US test cohort of 84 patients with incident colon adenocarcinoma, recruited between 1993 and 2002. We evaluated associations with tumor status, TNM staging, survival prognosis, and response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Associations were validated in a second, independent Chinese cohort of 113 patients recruited between 1991 and 2000, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The final date of follow-up was December 31, 2005, for the Maryland cohort and August 16, 2004, for the Hong Kong cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MicroRNAs that were differentially expressed in tumors and microRNA expression patterns associated with survival using cancer-specific death as the end point. RESULTS Thirty-seven microRNAs were differentially expressed in tumors from the test cohort. Selected for validation were miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203, and all 5 were enriched in tumors from the validation cohort (P {\textless} .001). Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) and in tumors with more advanced TNM staging (P {\textless} .001). In situ hybridization demonstrated miR-21 to be expressed at high levels in colonic carcinoma cells. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 57.5{\%} for the Maryland cohort and was 49.5{\%} for the Hong Kong cohort. High miR-21 expression was associated with poor survival in both the training (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2-5.2) and validation cohorts (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.4-3.9), independent of clinical covariates, including TNM staging, and was associated with a poor therapeutic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Expression patterns of microRNAs are systematically altered in colon adenocarcinomas. High miR-21 expression is associated with poor survival and poor therapeutic outcome.},

Reliable analytical procedures for the determination of salivary $\alpha$-amylase enzymatic activity and cortisol concentration in oral fluid were developed. The non-invasive sampling that does not require trained personnel represents one of the main advantages of oral fluid analysis compared to the analysis of blood and its derivatives (e.g. plasma). Since oral fluid offers the advantage of a simple and stress free sample collection, it is particularly useful to quantify stress related molecules. $\alpha$-amylase activity was measured by a spectrometric method, whereas salivary cortisol by Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. The effect of salivary pH and flow rate on salivary $\alpha$-amylase activity and cortisol were also investigated. Finally, both methods were preliminary tested on oral fluid samples of psoriatic volunteers underwent to a psychosocial stress task (the Trier Social Stress Test), as a first step of a more comprehensive study on the responsiveness of psoriatic subjects to stressors.},

Here, we bring together and discuss some of the 'tricks' that can be used to get the most out of pMHC multimers. These include: (1) simple procedures that can substantially enhance the staining intensity of cognate T cells with pMHC multimers; (2) the use of pMHC multimers to stain T cells with very-low-affinity T-cell receptor (TCR)/pMHC interactions, such as those that typically predominate in tumour-specific responses; and (3) the physical grading and clonotypic dissection of antigen-specific T cells based on the affinity of their cognate TCR using mutant pMHC multimers in conjunction with new approaches to the molecular analysis of TCR gene expression. We also examine how soluble pMHC can be used to examine T-cell activation, manipulate T-cell responses and study allogeneic and superantigen interactions with TCRs. Finally, we discuss the problems that arise with pMHC class II (pMHCII) multimers because of the low affinity of TCR/pMHCII interactions and lack of 'coreceptor help'.},

METHODS: We present a frequently traveling businessman whose nodular melanoma was detected by airport full body scanners. RESULTS: For about 20 flights over 2 months, the airport full body scanners singled out an area on his left lower leg for a pat-down. Dermatologic examination discovered a nodular melanoma in this area, and after surgical excision, the man traveled without incident. CONCLUSION: This case raises the possibility of using full body imaging in the detection of melanomas, especially of the nodular subtype. In its current form, full body scanning would most likely not be sensitive or specific enough to become a recommended screening tool. Nonetheless, for travelers with areas repeatedly singled out by the machines without a known justification, airport scanners could serve as incidental free screening for suspicious nodular lesions that should prompt dermatologist referral.},

abstract = {Sample preparation and fractionation technologies are one of the most crucial processes in proteomic analysis and biomarker discovery in solubilized samples. Chromatographic or electrophoretic proteomic technologies are also available for separation of cellular protein components. There are, however, considerable limitations in currently available proteomic technologies as none of them allows for the analysis of the entire proteome in a simple step because of the large number of peptides, and because of the wide concentration dynamic range of the proteome in clinical blood samples. The results of any undertaken experiment depend on the condition of the starting material. Therefore, proper experimental design and pertinent sample preparation is essential to obtain meaningful results, particularly in comparative clinical proteomics in which one is looking for minor differences between experimental (diseased) and control (nondiseased) samples. This review discusses problems associated with general and specialized strategies of sample preparation and fractionation, dealing with samples that are solution or suspension, in a frozen tissue state, or formalin-preserved tissue archival samples, and illustrates how sample processing might influence detection with mass spectrometric techniques. Strategies that dramatically improve the potential for cancer biomarker discovery in minimally invasive, blood-collected human samples are also presented.},

abstract = {Imagine a time where your health status could be available to you without the pain, discomfort and inconvenience of a physical examination. Distant vision of an inconceivable future or impending reality with potentially immeasurable impact? Recent advancements in the field of molecular diagnostics indicate this is not only possible, but closer than we think. Novel discoveries and substantial advancements have revealed that saliva may contain real-time information describing our overall physiological condition. Researchers are now reporting that, like blood and tissue biopsies, oral fluids could be a source of biochemical data capable of detecting certain diseases. What is even more intriguing is that this phenomenon not only applies to local disorders like oral cancer and Sj{\"{o}}gren's syndrome, but distant pathologies like autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as well as viral/bacterial infections and even some cancers. These revelations have provided a foundation for the burgeoning field of salivary diagnostics and hence spurred the onset of investigations poised at deciphering the salivary milieu. This paper overviews salivary diagnostics from biomarker development to the multitude of techniques utilized in identifying saliva-based molecular indicators of disease.

abstract = {When dealing with large scale gene expression studies, observations are commonly contaminated by unwanted variation factors such as platforms or batches. Not taking this unwanted variation into account when analyzing the data can lead to spurious associations and to missing important signals. When the analysis is unsupervised, e.g., when the goal is to cluster the samples or to build a corrected version of the dataset - as opposed to the study of an observed factor of interest - taking unwanted variation into account can become a difficult task. The unwanted variation factors may be correlated with the unobserved factor of interest, so that correcting for the former can remove the latter if not done carefully. We show how negative control genes and replicate samples can be used to estimate unwanted variation in gene expression, and discuss how this information can be used to correct the expression data or build estimators for unsupervised problems. The proposed methods are then evaluated on three gene expression datasets. They generally manage to remove unwanted variation without losing the signal of interest and compare favorably to state of the art corrections.},

The procedure makes use of resampling-based p-value adjustment, and is designed to cope with correlated test statistics. Some properties of the proposed procedure are investigated theoretically, and further properties are investigated using a simulation study. According to the results of the simulation study, the new procedure offers false discovery rate control and greater power. The motivation for developing this resampling-based procedure was an actual problem in meteorology, in which almost 2000 hypotheses are tested simultaneously using highly correlated test statistics. When applied to this problem the increase in power was evident. The same procedure can be used in many other large problems of multiple testing, for example multiple endpoints. The procedure is also extended to serve as a general diagnostic tool in model selection.},

RNA-Seq data takes the form of counts, so models based on the normal distribution are generally unsuitable. The problem is especially challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads, or ‘sequencing depths'. Existing methods for this problem are based on Poisson or negative binomial models: they are useful but can be heavily influenced by ‘outliers' in the data. We introduce a simple, non-parametric method with resampling to account for the different sequencing depths. The new method is more robust than parametric methods. It can be applied to data with quantitative, survival, two-class or multiple-class outcomes. We compare our proposed method to Poisson and negative binomial-based methods in simulated and real data sets, and find that our method discovers more consistent patterns than competing methods.},

abstract = {A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.},

abstract = {In the theory of linear models, the concept of degrees of freedom plays an important role. This concept is often used for mea- surement of model complexity, for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the error variance, and for comparison of different models. I have developed a concept of generalized degrees of freedom (GDF) that is applicable to complex modeling procedures. The definition is based on the sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value to perturbation in the corresponding observed value. The concept is nonasymptotic in nature and does not require analytic knowledge of the modeling procedures. The concept of GDF offers a unified framework under which complex and highly irregular modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same way as classical linear models. By using this framework, many difficult problems can be solved easily. For example, one can now measure the number of observations used in a variable selection process. Different modeling procedures, such as a tree-based regression and a projection pursuit regression, can be compared on the basis of their residual sums of squares and the GDF that they cost. I apply the proposed framework to measure the effect of variable selection in linear models, leading to corrections of selection bias in various goodness-of-fit statistics. The theory also has interesting implications for the effect of general model searching by a human modeler.},

abstract = {The simplicity and potential of minimally invasive testing using sera from patients makes auto-antibody based biomarkers a very promising tool for use in can-cer diagnostics. Protein microarrays have been used for the identification of such auto-antibody signatures. Because high throughput protein expression and purifi-cation is laborious, synthetic peptides might be a good alternative for microarray generation and multiplexed analyses. In this study, we designed 1185 antigenic pep-tides, deduced from proteins expressed by 642 cDNA expression clones found to be sero-reactive in both breast tumour patients and controls. The sero-reactive proteins and the corresponding peptides were used for the production of protein and peptide microarrays. Se-rum samples from females with benign and malignant breast tumours and healthy control sera (n=16 per group) were then analysed. Correct classification of the serum samples on peptide microarrays were 78{\%} for discrimination of ‘malignant versus healthy controls', 72{\%} for ‘benign versus malignant' and 94{\%} for ‘benign versus controls'. On protein arrays, correct classification for these contrasts was 69{\%}, 59{\%} and 59{\%}, respectively. The over-representation analysis of the classi-fiers derived from class prediction showed enrichment of genes associated with ribosomes, spliceosomes, en-docytosis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Se-quence analyses of the peptides with the highest sero-reactivity demonstrated enrichment of the zinc-finger domain. Peptides' sero-reactivities were found nega-tively correlated with hydrophobicity and positively correlated with positive charge, high inter-residue pro-tein contact energies and a secondary structure propen-sity bias. This study hints at the possibility of using in silico designed antigenic peptide microarrays as an alternative to protein microarrays for the improvement of tumour auto-antibody based diagnostics.},

In the present study, we focus on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which represent one of the most widely investigated carbon nanoparticles. The present data indicate that CNTs are able to cross the cell membrane of rat macrophages (NR8383) and, therefore, might have an influence on cell physiology and function. NR8383 and human A549 lung cells were incubated with commercial single-walled (NT-1) and multi-walled (NT-2, NT-3) CNTs, carbon black and quartz as reference particles as well as an acid-treated single-walled CNT preparation (SWCNT a.t.) with reduced metal catalyst content. We did not observe any acute toxicity on cell viability (WST-1, PI-staining) upon incubation with all CNT products. None of the CNTs induced the inflammatory mediators NO, TNF-alpha and IL-8. A rising tendency of TNF-alpha release from LPS-primed cells due to CNT treatment could be observed. We detected however, a dose- and time-dependent increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species and a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential with the commercial CNTs in both cell types after particle treatment whereas incubation with the purified CNTs (SWCNT a.t.) had no effect. This leads us to the conclusion that metal traces associated with the commercial nanotubes are responsible for the biological effects.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) allows quantitative measurement of expression levels of genes and their transcripts. In this study, we sequenced complementary DNA fragments of cultured human B-cells and obtained 879 million 50-bp reads comprising 44 Gb of sequence. The results allowed us to study the gene expression profile of B-cells and to determine experimental parameters for sequencing-based expression studies. We identified 20,766 genes and 67,453 of their alternatively spliced transcripts. More than 90{\%} of the genes with multiple exons are alternatively spliced; for most genes, one isoform is predominantly expressed. We found that while chromosomes differ in gene density, the percentage of transcribed genes in each chromosome is less variable. In addition, genes involved in related biological processes are expressed at more similar levels than genes with different functions. Besides characterizing gene expression, we also used the data to investigate the effect of sequencing depth on gene expression measurements. While 100 million reads are sufficient to detect most expressed genes and transcripts, about 500 million reads are needed to measure accurately their expression levels. We provide examples in which deep sequencing is needed to determine the relative abundance of genes and their isoforms. With data from 20 individuals and about 40 million sequence reads per sample, we uncovered only 21 alternatively spliced, multi-exon genes that are not in databases; this result suggests that at this sequence coverage, we can detect most of the known genes. Results from this project are available on the UCSC Genome Browser to allow readers to study the expression and structure of genes in human B-cells.},

abstract = {The comparative utility of serum and saliva as diagnostic fluids for identifying biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was investigated. The goal was to determine if salivary biomarkers could facilitate a screening diagnosis of AMI, especially in cases of non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI), since these cases are not readily identified by electrocardiogram (ECG). Serum and unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) collected from 92 AMI patients within 48 hours of chest pain onset and 105 asymptomatic healthy control individuals were assayed for 13 proteins relevant to cardiovascular disease, by Beadlyte technology (Luminex({\textregistered})) and enzyme immunoassays. Data were analyzed with concentration cut-points, ECG findings, logistic regression (LR) (adjusted for matching for age, gender, race, smoking, number of teeth, and oral health status), and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by repetition of the CART analysis in 58 cases and 58 controls, each matched by age and gender. Serum biomarkers demonstrated AMI sensitivity and specificity superior to that of saliva, as determined by LR and CART. The predominant discriminators in serum by LR were troponin I (TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and TnI and BNP by CART. In saliva, LR identified C-reactive protein (CRP) as the biomarker most predictive of AMI. A combination of smoking tobacco, UWS CRP, CK-MB, sCD40 ligand, gender, and number of teeth identified AMI in the CART decision trees. When ECG findings, salivary biomarkers, and confounders were included, AMI was predicted with 80.0{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity. These analyses support the potential utility of salivary biomarker measurements used with ECG for the identification of AMI. Thus, saliva-based tests may provide additional diagnostic screening information in the clinical course for patients suspected of having an AMI.},

The study of multiple sclerosis can benefit from the use of biomarkers because of the disease's inherent heterogeneity. Biomarkers in multiple sclerosis might assist with diagnosis, prediction of disease course, or identification of response outcome to treatments. Despite the need for biomarkers and extensife research to identify them, validation and clinical application of biomarkers is still an unmet need in multiple sclerosis, and large gaps remain between exploratory biomarkers proposed in many studies, validated biomarkers, and biomarkers that are integrated into routine clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric resonators have been in use as mass-sensing devices for almost half a century. More recently it was recognized that shifts in frequency and bandwidth can come about by a diverse variety of interactions with the sample. The classical "load" consists of a thin film, which shifts the resonance frequency due to its inertia. Other types of loading include semi-infinite viscoelastic media, rough objects contacting the crystal via isolated asperities, mechanically nonlinear contacts, and dielectric films. All these interactions can be analyzed within the small-load approximation. The small-load approximation provides a unified frame for interpretation and thereby opens the way to new applications of the QCM.},

abstract = {Phage display is the technology that allows expression of exogenous (poly)peptides on the surface of phage particles. The concept is simple in principle: a library of phage particles expressing a wide diversity of peptides is used to select those that bind the desired target. The filamentous phage M13 is the most commonly used vector to create random peptide display libraries. Several methods including recombinant techniques have been developed to increase the diversity of the library. On the other extreme, libraries with various biases can be created for specific purposes. For instance, when the sequence of the peptide that binds the target is known, its affinity and selectivity can be increased by screening libraries created with limited mutagenesis of the peptide. Phage libraries are screened for binding to synthetic or native targets. The initial screening of library by basic biopanning has been extended to column chromatography including negative screening and competition between selected phage clones to identify high affinity ligands with greater target specificity. The rapid isolation of specific ligands by phage display is advantageous in many applications including selection of inhibitors for the active and allosteric sites of the enzymes, receptor agonists and antagonists, and G-protein binding modulatory peptides. Phage display has been used in epitope mapping and analysis of protein-protein interactions. The specific ligands isolated from phage libraries can be used in therapeutic target validation, drug design and vaccine development. Phage display can also be used in conjunction with other methods. The past innovations and those to come promise a bright future for this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The production of cytotoxic T cells with specificity for cancer cells is a rapidly evolving branch of cancer therapeutics. A variety of approaches aim to amplify anti-tumour cytotoxic T cell responses using purified peptides, tumour cell lysates or recombinant HLA/peptide complexes in differing antigen presenting systems. Using a two-step biotin-streptavidin antibody targeting system, recombinant HLA-class I/peptide complexes were attached to the surface of B cells via the anti-CD20 B9E9-scFvSA antibody-streptavidin fusion protein. Flow cytometry with a conformation dependant monoclonal antibody to HLA class I indicated that targeted HLA-class I/peptide complexes remain on the surface of B cells in culture for periods in excess of 72 h. PBMCs were stimulated in vitro for 8-14 days using the autologous B cells as antigen presenting cells. Following a single cycle of stimulation specific cytotoxic T cell responses to targeted HLA-A2 complexes containing the M1, BMLF1 and Melan A peptides could be demonstrated by tetramer staining and Cr release assays. With the HLA-A2/BMLF1 complex up to 2.99{\%} of CD8+ve cells were tetramer positive producing 20{\%} lysis (E : T 10 : 1) of CIR-A2 target cells in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay compared to baseline levels of 0.09{\%} tetramer +ve and 2{\%} lysis in the unstimulated population. PBMCs from a healthy donor treated with two cycles of stimulations with targeted HLA-A2/Melan A complexes, demonstrated expansion of the melanA tetramer +ve population from 0.03{\%} to 1.4{\%} producing 15{\%} lysis of Melan A pulsed target cells. With further consideration to the key variables of HLA/peptide complex density, the ratio of stimulator to effector cells and optimum cytokine support, this system should offer an easy and effective method for the in vitro amplification of specific cytotoxic T cell responses and warrants development for the in vivo induction of cytotoxic T cell responses in cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Coined in the late eighties, the term "angiogenic switch" refers to a time-restricted event during tumor progression where the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors tilts towards a pro-angiogenic outcome, resulting in the transition from dormant avascularized hyperplasia to outgrowing vascularized tumor and eventually to malignant tumor progression. The molecular players and mechanisms underlying the angiogenic switch have been intensely investigated. In particular, a large number of pro-angiogenic factors and angiogenic inhibitors activated and repressed, respectively, in their activities during the angiogenic switch have been identified and characterized. Part of this research has lead to the development of various pro- and anti-angiogenic therapies that are currently tested in clinical trials or are already in clinical use. More recently, transgenic mouse models of cancer have been instrumental in revealing that inflammatory responses within the tumor microenvironment are critically contributing to the onset of tumor angiogenesis. These mouse models closely recapitulate multistage carcinogenesis in cancer patients and represent reliable tools to study the molecular and cellular players implicated in the onset and maintenance of tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, they also offer the opportunity to assess the efficacy of novel anti-angiogenic cancer therapies and the nature of developing resistance mechanisms. These experiments have provided first important concepts to improve anti-angiogenic therapy and thus directly contribute to their translation to the clinical setting.},

Various accuracy measures for s(x) can be obtained from the bootstrap values, e.g. the bootstrap estimates of standard error and bias, or the length and shape of bootstrap confidence intervals. We might wonder how accurate these accuracy measures themselves are, or how sensitive they are to small changes in the individual data points xi. It turns out that these questions can be answered from the information in the original bootstrap sample s* 1,s* 2, ..., s* B, with no further resampling required. The answers, which make use of the jackknife and delta method influence functions, are easy to apply and can give informative results, as shown by several examples.},

abstract = {SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions is one of the most commonly used techniques for recombinant monoclonal antibody purity and stability indicating assay. On non-reducing SDS-PAGE, bands with a lower molecular weight than the intact antibody are routinely observed and is a common feature of IgG molecules. These fragments were analyzed by in-gel digestion followed by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, Western blot and by comparing the banding pattern of sample prepared in the presence of a reducing reagent. The fragments bands were identified as antibody lacking one light chain, two heavy chains, one light chain and one heavy chain, free heavy chain and free light chain. Sensitivity of fragmentation to sample buffer pH, incubation time, reducing reagent and alkylation reagents indicated that fragments were formed during sample preparation, but not present in the samples analyzed. Disulfide bond scrambling and beta-elimination are the two major mechanisms of the formation antibody fragments. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that disulfide bond scrambling can be prevented by specifically modifying free sulhydryl using alkylation and thus reduced the amount of artifacts on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Breakage of disulfide bonds by beta-elimination was evidenced by the detection of dehydroalanine using mass spectrometry.},

Nanopore sequencing of proteins was also envisioned. Although proteins have been shown to move through nanopores, a technique to unfold proteins for processive translocation has yet to be demonstrated. Here we describe controlled unfolding and translocation of proteins through the $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL) pore using the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX. Sequence-dependent features of individual engineered proteins were detected during translocation.

abstract = {Interest in saliva as a diagnostic fluid for monitoring general health and for early diagnosis of disease has increased in the last few years. In particular, efforts have focused on the generation of protein maps of saliva using advanced proteomics technology. Surface-enhanced laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) is a novel high throughput and extremely sensitive proteomic approach that allows protein expression profiling of large sets of complex biological specimens. In this study, large scale profiling of salivary proteins and peptides, ranging from 2 to 100kDa was demonstrated using SELDI-TOF-MS. Various methodological aspects and pre-analytical variables were analysed with respect to their effects on saliva SELDI-TOF-MS profiling. Results show that chip surface type and sample type (unstimulated versus stimulated) critically affect the amount and composition of detected salivary proteins. Factors that influenced normal saliva protein profiling were matrix composition, sample dilution and binding buffer properties. Delayed processing time experiments show certain new peptides evolving 3h post-saliva donation, and quantitative analyses indicate relative intensity of other proteins and peptides changing with time. The addition of protease inhibitors partly counteracted the destabilization of certain protein/peptide mass spectra over time suggesting that some proteins in saliva are subject to digestion by intrinsic salivary proteases. SELDI-TOF-MS profiles also changed by varying storage time and storage temperature whereas centrifugation speed and freeze-thaw cycles had minimal impact. In conclusion, SELDI-TOF-MS offers a high throughput platform for saliva protein and peptide profiling, however, (pre-)analytical conditions must be taken into account for valid interpretation of the acquired data.},

abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a C p estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

Background and Objective: The determination of warfarin, RS/SR- and RR/SSwarfarin alcohols in oral fluid may offer additional information to the INR assay. This study aimed to establish an optimized sampling technique providing the best correlation between the oral fluid and the unbound plasma concentrations of these compounds. Materials and Methods: Samples of non-stimulated and stimulated oral fluid, and blood were collected from 14 patients undergoing warfarin therapy. After acidification, analytes were extracted with a dichloromethane/hexane mixture and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Plasma samples were also ultrafiltered for the determination of the unbound fraction. The chromatographic separation was carried out in isocratic conditions with a phosphate buffer/methanol mobile phase on a C-18 reversed-phase column. The absence of interfering compounds was verified by HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Results: Stimulation generally increased the oral fluid pH to values close to blood pH in about 6 minutes. The concentration of warfarin and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols in oral fluid followed the same trend, whereas the concentration of RR/SS-warfarin alcohols was not affected. Six minute stimulation with chewing gum followed by collection with a polyester swab was the best sampling procedure, with a good repeatability (RSD 〈10{\%}) and relatively low inter-subject variability (RSD =30{\%}) of the oral fluid to plasma ratio. This procedure provided strong correlations between the measured oral fluid and unbound plasma concentration of warfarin (r = 0.92, p 〈0.001) and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r =5 0.84, p 〈0.001), as well as between stimulated oral fluid and total plasma concentration of warfarin (r = 0.78, p 〈0.001) and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r = 0.81, p 〈0.001). Conclusion: The very good correlation between oral fluid and unbound plasma concentration of warfarin and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols suggests that oral fluid analysis could provide clinically useful information for the monitoring of anticoagulant therapy, complentary to the INR assay.},

abstract = {Development of the appropriate CD4+ T helper (TH) subset during an immune response is important for disease resolution. With the use of naive, ovalbumin-specific alpha beta T cell receptor transgenic T cell, it was found that heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes induced TH1 development in vitro through macrophage production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Moreover, inhibition of macrophage production of IL-12 may explain the ability of IL-10 to suppress TH1 development. Murine immune responses to L. monocytogenes in vivo are of the appropriate TH1 phenotype. Therefore, this regulatory pathway may have evolved to enable innate immune cells, through interactions with microbial pathogens, to direct development of specific immunity toward the appropriate TH phenotype. },

Effective data management and analytical approaches are essential to fully decipher the biological knowledge contained in the tremendous amount of experimental data. Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining multiple studies of a related hypothesis, has become popular in genomic research. Here, we perform a systematic search from PubMed and manual collection to obtain 620 genomic meta-analysis papers, of which 333 microarray meta-analysis papers are summarized as the basis of this paper and the other 249 GWAS meta-analysis papers are discussed in the next companion paper. The review in the present paper focuses on various biological purposes of microarray meta-analysis, databases and software and related statistical procedures. Statistical considerations of such an analysis are further scrutinized and illustrated by a case study. Finally, several open questions are listed and discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, screening must detect life-threatening disease at an earlier, more curable stage. Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease) and late-stage breast cancer (regional and distant disease) among women 40 years of age or older.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year, from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women. Concomitantly, the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8{\%}, from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women. With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden, only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease. After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years. We estimated that in 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women; this accounted for 31{\%} of all breast cancers diagnosed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer. Although it is not certain which women have been affected, the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis, accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.},

abstract = {Tumour-associated antigens (TAA) can be detected prior to clinical diagnosis and thus would be ideal biomarkers for early detection of cancer using only a few microliters of a patient's serum. In this article we provide a summary of TAA screening and serum-profiling conducted for breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers. Different methodological approaches, including SEREX, SERPA, and phage display for TAA identification and TAA panels are summarised, and a revision of array based techniques is provided. The most promising studies performed on these cancers (performed with 80-400 serum samples, including controls) obtained sensitivities in a range of 44-95{\%} and specificities of 80-100{\%}. From the various studies reviewed, only one performed cross validation (AUC = 0.71) in a prostate cancer study. Thus, albeit receiver operation characteristics are very promising, cross validation of most studies is still missing. Additionally, the concerted action of research groups for standardization of serum-TAA testing and cross validation is required. Along with today's technological options, the chances of establishing TAA biomarkers are now higher than ever before. This may also be true for confirmation and validation of already existing data, which is a prerequisite for implementation of TAA biomarkers into clinical diagnostics.

abstract = {Whether the recently identified innate lymphocyte population coexpressing natural killer cell receptors (NKRs) and the nuclear receptor ROR$\gamma$t is part of the NK or lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cell lineage remains unclear. By using adoptive transfer of genetically tagged LTi-like cells, we demonstrate that NKRROR$\gamma$t(+) innate lymphocytes but not NK cells were direct progenitors to NKR(+)ROR$\gamma$t(+) cells in vivo. Genetic lineage tracing revealed that the differentiation of LTi-like cells was characterized by the stable upregulation of NKRs and a progressive loss of ROR$\gamma$t expression. Whereas interleukin-7 (IL-7) and intestinal microbiota stabilized ROR$\gamma$t expression within such NKR-LTi cells, IL-12 and IL-15 accelerated ROR$\gamma$t loss. ROR$\gamma$t(+) NKR-LTi cells produced IL-22, whereas ROR$\gamma$t NKR-LTi cells released IFN-$\gamma$ and were potent inducers of colitis. Thus, the ROR$\gamma$t gradient in NKR-LTi cells serves as a tunable rheostat for their functional program. Our data also define a previously unappreciated role of ROR$\gamma$t NKR-LTi cells for the onset or maintenance of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

abstract = {Alhydrogel{\textregistered} (aluminum hydroxide) is a widely used adjuvant in the US. Regulatory authorities require that vaccines be tested to determine the antigen content in the final vaccine product. The level of formulated antigen is currently determined in our laboratory by the o-Phthalaldehyde (OPA) fluorescent protein assay, and antigen identity and integrity are determined by Western blot and SDS-PAGE. However, OPA assay is non-specific and only limited to detection of total protein content, and it is often not sensitive enough to detect antigens in low dose formulations. Furthermore, antigens used in identity and integrity tests must be extracted from vaccines using an extraction procedure which is time-consuming and may not completely recover antigens for analysis or may alter the structures of antigens during extraction. The present study developed a Direct Alum Formulation Immunoassay (DAFIA) which was designed to directly (without antigen extraction), accurately, and sensitively determine the antigen content, identity and integrity on alum. The AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel formulation was used as a model vaccine in assay development and validation. The results showed that the DAFIA is highly antigen-specific, accurate (87-100{\%}), sensitive (0.16 $\mu$g/ml), reproducible, and simple with a linear detection range of 0.16-10 $\mu$g/ml. These results demonstrate that DAFIA is an excellent assay to determine antigen content, identity and integrity of antigens bound to alum and may be used in routine vaccine quality control for testing antigens in Alhydrogel-based vaccines.},

abstract = {Although the search for disease biomarkers continues, the clinical return has thus far been disappointing. The complexity of the body's response to disease makes it difficult to represent this response with only a few biomarkers, particularly when many are present at low levels. An alternative to the typical reductionist biomarker paradigm is an assay we call an "immunosignature." This approach leverages the response of antibodies to disease-related changes, as well as the inherent signal amplification associated with antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. To perform an immunosignature assay, the antibodies in diluted blood are incubated with a microarray of thousands of random sequence peptides. The pattern of binding to these peptides is the immunosignature. Because the peptide sequences are completely random, the assay is effectively disease-agnostic, potentially providing a comprehensive diagnostic on multiple diseases simultaneously. To explore the ability of an immunosignature to detect and identify multiple diseases simultaneously, 20 samples from each of five cancer cohorts collected from multiple sites and 20 noncancer samples (120 total) were used as a training set to develop a reference immunosignature. A blinded evaluation of 120 blinded samples covering the same diseases gave 95{\%} classification accuracy. To investigate the breadth of the approach and test sensitivity to biological diversity further, immunosignatures of {\textgreater}1,500 historical samples comprising 14 different diseases were examined by training with 75{\%} of the samples and testing the remaining 25{\%}. The average accuracy was {\textgreater}98{\%}. These results demonstrate the potential power of the immunosignature approach in the accurate, simultaneous classification of disease.},

abstract = {Recent evidence supports the critical and proximate role of IL-12 in regulating both T and NK cell function during inflammation. In these studies, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of murine IL-12 in murine adenocarcinoma and sarcoma models using both systemic and peritumoral administration. Antitumor effects were consistently demonstrated both in models of microdisease, in which IL-12 treatment was initiated soon after tumor inoculation (1 to 5 days), and in animals bearing large established tumors (7 to 14 days). Treatment with IL-12 markedly prolonged survival and, in most cases, caused complete tumor regression. Significant reduction in pulmonary metastases after systemic treatment was observed when treatment was delayed for 10 days after tumor inoculation. Increases in serum IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and nitrogen oxides were demonstrated, exceeding those observed with IL-2 treatment. Systemic administration of anti-IFN-gamma Abs before IL-12 treatment nearly completely abrogated the antitumor effect in experiments using subcutaneous tumors or pulmonary metastases. Depletion of the individual T cell subsets CD4 and CD8 by systemic administration of mAbs diminished the effectiveness of IL-12 when administered in combination. An infiltrate composed primarily of CD8+ + cells was demonstrated by using immunohistochemical analysis of tumors after IL-12 treatment. Minimal apparent toxicity was demonstrated at effective doses (0.1 to 1.0 microgram/day) of IL-12. These results indicate that IL-12 is an effective and minimally toxic antitumor agent in murine tumor models and leads to an immune-mediated rejection involving, at least in part, IFN-gamma, CD4+, and CD8+ cells. Human clinical trials of IL-12 for the treatment of malignancy are supported by these studies. },

abstract = {High-throughput 'omic' data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, DNA copy number, has played an instrumental role in furthering our understanding of the molecular basis in states of human health and disease. As cells with similar morphological characteristics can exhibit entirely different molecular profiles and because of the potential that these discrepancies might further our understanding of patient-level variability in clinical outcomes, there is significant interest in the use of high-throughput 'omic' data for the identification of novel molecular subtypes of a disease. While numerous clustering methods have been proposed for identifying of molecular subtypes, most were developed for single "omic' data types and may not be appropriate when more than one 'omic' data type are collected on study subjects. Given that complex diseases, such as cancer, arise as a result of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations, integrative clustering methods for the simultaneous clustering of multiple 'omic' data types have great potential to aid in molecular subtype discovery. Traditionally, ad hoc manual data integration has been performed using the results obtained from the clustering of individual 'omic' data types on the same set of patient samples. However, such methods often result in inconsistent assignment of subjects to the molecular cancer subtypes. Recently, several methods have been proposed in the literature that offers a rigorous framework for the simultaneous integration of multiple 'omic' data types in a single comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we present a systematic review of existing integrative clustering methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Combining genomic data sets from multiple studies is advantageous to increase statistical power in studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or require the sequential generation of data. However, significant technical heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of data that are generated from different processing or reagent batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These so-called batch effects often confound true biological relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of combining multiple batches, and may even lead to spurious results in some combined studies. Therefore there is significant need for effective methods and software tools that account for batch effects in high-throughput genomic studies. RESULTS Here we contribute multiple methods and software tools for improved combination and analysis of data from multiple batches. In particular, we provide batch effect solutions for cases where the severity of the batch effects is not extreme, and for cases where one high-quality batch can serve as a reference, such as the training set in a biomarker study. We illustrate our approaches and software in both simulated and real data scenarios. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the value of these new contributions compared to currently established approaches in the specified batch correction situations.},

@article{Greenland2016,
abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {Previous work indicates that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) given IP to mice alter the regulation of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related genes in brain. Here we assessed the distribution and toxic potential of AgNP following intranasal (IN) exposure. Adult male C57BL/6J mice received 25-nm AgNP (100 or 500 mg/kg) once IN. After 1 or 7 days, histopathology of selected organs was performed, and tissue reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured as an indicator of oxidative stress. Aggregated AgNP were found in spleen, lung, kidney, and nasal airway by routine light microscopy. Splenic AgNP accumulation was greatest in red pulp and occurred with modestly reduced cellularity and elevated hemosiderin deposition. Aggregated AgNP were not associated with microscopic changes in other tissues except for nasal mucosal erosions. Autometallography revealed AgNP in olfactory bulb and the lateral brain ventricles. Neither inflammatory cell infiltrates nor activated microglia were detected in brains of AgNP-treated mice. Elevated tissue GSH levels was observed in nasal epithelia (both doses at 1 day, 500 mg/kg at 7 days) and blood (500 mg/kg at 7 days). Therefore, IN administration of AgNP permits systemic distribution, produces reversible oxidative stress in the nose and in blood, and mildly enhances macrophage-mediated erythrocyte destruction in the spleen.},

However, conventional chemotherapy suffers lack of aqueous solubility, lack of selectivity and multidrug resistance. Nanotherapeutics is rapidly progressing aimed to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. Nonspecific target of cancer chemotherapy leads to damage rapidly proliferating normal cells and can be significantly reduced through folate and transferrin mediated nanotherapeutics which are aimed to target cancerous cells. Multidrug resistance is challenge in cancer chemotherapy which can be significantly reversed by solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, nanoparticulated chemosensitizer, nanoparticluated poloxamer and magnetic nanoparticles. Hydrophobic nature of chemotherapeutics leads to poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability which can be overcome by nanocrystals, albumin based nanoparticles, liposomal formulation, polymeric micelles, cyclodextrin and chitosan based nanoparticles. This review focuses the role of nanotherapeutics to overcome lack of selectivity, multidrug resistance and lack of aqueous solubility of conventional cancer chemotherapy.},

abstract = {There are many sources of systematic variation in cDNA microarray experiments which affect the measured gene expression levels (e.g. differences in labeling efficiency between the two fluorescent dyes). The term normalization refers to the process of removing such variation. A constant adjustment is often used to force the distribution of the intensity log ratios to have a median of zero for each slide. However, such global normalization approaches are not adequate in situations where dye biases can depend on spot overall intensity and/or spatial location within the array. This article proposes normalization methods that are based on robust local regression and account for intensity and spatial dependence in dye biases for different types of cDNA microarray experiments. The selection of appropriate controls for normalization is discussed and a novel set of controls (microarray sample pool, MSP) is introduced to aid in intensity-dependent normalization. Lastly, to allow for comparisons of expression levels across slides, a robust method based on maximum likelihood estimation is proposed to adjust for scale differences among slides.},

A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data.

Areas highlighted include the application of single-cell genomics to interrogate microbial dark matter and to evaluate the pathogenic roles of genetic mosaicism in multicellular organisms, with a focus on cancer.

METHODS: The use of different fluorescence readout channels allows the parallel use of a competitive system and a sandwich configuration. The 2 generated assay signals are combined and used to calculate the amount of analyte. The measurement range can be adjusted by varying the competitor concentration, and an extension of the assay system's dynamic range is possible. RESULTS: We implemented the method in a planar protein microarray-based autoimmune assay to detect autoantibodies against 13 autoantigens and to measure the concentration of a highly abundant protein, total human IgG, in one assay. Our results for autoantibody detection and IgG quantification agreed with results obtained with commercially available assays. The use of 2 readout channels in the protein microarray-based system reduced spot-to-spot variation and intraassay variation. CONCLUSIONS: By combining a direct immunoassay with a competitive system, analytes present in widely varying concentrations can be quantified within a single multiplex assay. Introducing a second readout channel for analyte quantification is an effective tool for spot-to-spot normalization and helps to lower intraassay variation.},

abstract = {A method (denoted SISCAPA) for quantitation of peptides in complex digests is described. In the method, anti-peptide antibodies immobilized on 100 nanoliter nanoaffinity columns are used to enrich specific peptides along with spiked stable-isotope-labeled internal standards of the same sequence. Upon elution from the anti-peptide antibody supports, electrospray mass spectrometry is used to quantitate the peptides (natural and labeled). In a series of pilot experiments, tryptic test peptides were chosen for four proteins of human plasma (hemopexin, alpha1 antichymotrypsin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) from a pool of 10,203 in silico tryptic peptide candidates representing 237 known plasma components. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the chosen peptide sequences were affinity purified and covalently immobilized on POROS supports. Binding and elution from these supports was shown to provide an average 120-fold enrichment of the antigen peptide relative to others, as measured by selected ion monitoring (SIM) or selected reaction monitoring (SRM) electrospray mass spectrometry. The columns could be recycled with little loss in binding capacity, and generated peptide ion current measurements with cycle-to-cycle coefficients of variation near 5{\%}. Anti-peptide antibody enrichment will contribute to increased sensitivity of MS-based assays, particularly for lower abundance proteins in plasma, and may ultimately allow substitution of a rapid bind/elute process for the time-consuming reverse phase separation now used as a prelude to online MS peptide assays. The method appears suitable for rapid generation of assays for defined proteins, and should find application in the validation of diagnostic protein panels in large sample sets.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {Glucose oxidase-containing liposomes (GOL) as well as detergent-modulated glucose oxidase-containing liposomes were prepared and characterized, focusing not only on the reactivity of the liposomes upon external addition of glucose but also on the leakage of the entrapped glucose oxidase (GO) from the liposomes with the aim of developing a reactive and stable liposomal GO system. The membranes of the GOL prepared were composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and modulated with either Triton X-100 or cholate. In the absence of added detergent, no GO leakage from the GOL was observed while its enzymatic activity was very low (low glucose permeability). As detergent-modulated liposomes, mixed POPC/Triton X-100 and mixed POPC/cholate liposomes (abbreviated as TL and CL, respectively) were prepared at different effective detergent/POPC molar ratios (R(e)) ranging from R(e) = 0 to R(e) = R(e) (sat) (R(e) (sat) is the critical value of R(e) at which the liposome membrane is saturated with detergent). The reactivity of GO-loaded TL (abbreviated as GOTL) or GO-loaded CL (GOCL) increased drastically with increase in the respective detergent content in the liposomes. In the case of GOTL, at R(e) (sat) = 0.40, a high reactivity was measured with a simultaneous high extent of GO leakage, suggesting that the observed enzymatic reaction was catalyzed mainly by leaked GO, caused by the interaction of Triton X-100 with the POPC membrane. On the other hand, GOCL prepared at R(e) (sat) = 0.43 showed relatively high reactivity with only a small extent of GO leakage, suggesting that most of the enzyme reaction was limited by the glucose permeation across the bilayers of GOCL. The GO leakage from GOCL was found to occur mostly during the rearrangement of the liposomal membrane during the preparation of the GOCL (mixing the GOL and cholate). Fluorescence polarization measurements of membrane-associated DPH (1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene) indicated that CL prepared by modifying POPC with cholate did not lead to a drastic change in membrane fluidity, indicating that the interacting cholate molecules did not penetrate deeply into the POPC bilayers. In summary, it was clearly shown that the membrane permeability of GOL can be quite simply modulated by mixing it with a certain amount of cholate to form highly reactive and stable GOCL with minimal enzyme leakage.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis has proved to be an invaluable tool for the exploratory and unsupervised analysis of high-dimensional datasets. Among methods for clustering, hierarchical approaches have enjoyed substantial popularity in genomics and other fields for their ability to simultaneously uncover multiple layers of clustering structure. A critical and challenging question in cluster analysis is whether the identified clusters represent important underlying structure or are artifacts of natural sampling variation. Few approaches have been proposed for addressing this problem in the context of hierarchical clustering, for which the problem is further complicated by the natural tree structure of the partition, and the multiplicity of tests required to parse the layers of nested clusters. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo based approach for testing statistical significance in hierarchical clustering which addresses these issues. The approach is implemented as a sequential testing procedure guaranteeing control of the family-wise error rate. Theoretical justification is provided for our approach, and its power to detect true clustering structure is illustrated through several simulation studies and applications to two cancer gene expression datasets.},

abstract = {The characterization of the humoral response in cancer patients is becoming a practical alternative to improve early detection. We prepared phage microarrays containing colorectal cancer cDNA libraries to identify phage-expressed peptides recognized by tumor-specific autoantibodies from patient sera. From a total of 1536 printed phages, 128 gave statistically significant values to discriminate cancer patients from control samples. From this, 43 peptide sequences were unique following DNA sequencing. Six phages containing homologous sequences to STK4/MST1, SULF1, NHSL1, SREBF2, GRN, and GTF2I were selected to build up a predictor panel. A previous study with high-density protein microarrays had identified STK4/MST1 as a candidate biomarker. An independent collection of 153 serum samples (50 colorectal cancer sera and 103 reference samples, including healthy donors and sera from other related pathologies) was used as a validation set to study prediction capability. A combination of four phages and two recombinant proteins, corresponding to MST1 and SULF1, achieved an area under the curve of 0.86 to correctly discriminate cancer from healthy sera. Inclusion of sera from other different neoplasias did not change significantly this value. For early stages (A+B), the corrected area under the curve was 0.786. Moreover, we have demonstrated that MST1 and SULF1 proteins, homologous to phage-peptide sequences, can replace the original phages in the predictor panel, improving their diagnostic accuracy.},

We investigate the relation between overfitting and accurate class probability estimation in terms of mean square error. Using simulation studies based on real datasets, we found that some degree of overfitting can be desirable for reducing mean square error.

Where possible, we compare the performance of the new algorithms to that of their established counterparts in OpenMS. We validate the pipeline on the basis of two small data sets that provide ground truths for the quantification.

There has been much less research on the toxicology of nanoparticles that are used for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, in which the nanoparticles are deliberately placed in the body. Moreover, there are no harmonized standards for assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles to the immune system (immunotoxicity). Here we review recent research on immunotoxicity, along with data on a range of nanotechnology-based drugs that are at different stages in the approval process. Research shows that nanoparticles can stimulate and/or suppress the immune responses, and that their compatibility with the immune system is largely determined by their surface chemistry. Modifying these factors can significantly reduce the immunotoxicity of nanoparticles and make them useful platforms for drug delivery.},

This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address. We review experimental and computational approaches for doing so.},

abstract = {LINE-1 expression damages host DNA via insertions and endonuclease-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are highly toxic and mutagenic. The predominant tissue of LINE-1 expression has been considered to be the germ line. We show that both full-length and processed L1 transcripts are widespread in human somatic tissues and transformed cells, with significant variation in both L1 expression and L1 mRNA processing. This is the first demonstration that RNA processing is a major regulator of L1 activity. Many tissues also produce translatable spliced transcript (SpORF2). An Alu retrotransposition assay, COMET assays and 53BP1 foci staining show that the SpORF2 product can support functional ORF2 protein expression and can induce DNA damage in normal cells. Tests of the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase expression suggest that expression of exogenous full-length L1, or the SpORF2 mRNA alone in human fibroblasts and adult stem cells triggers a senescence-like phenotype, which is one of the reported responses to DNA damage. In contrast to previous assumptions that L1 expression is germ line specific, the increased spectrum of tissues exposed to L1-associated damage suggests a role for L1 as an endogenous mutagen in somatic tissues. These findings have potential consequences for the whole organism in the form of cancer and mammalian aging.},

By systematic analysis of the IL-12-induced immune response to subcutaneous melanoma (B16), we found that tumor suppression was mediated independently of T lymphocytes or NK cells. IL-12 initiated local antitumor immunity by stimulating a subset of NKp46(+) lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells dependent on the transcription factor ROR$\gamma$t. The presence of these NKp46(+) LTi cells induced upregulation of adhesion molecules in the tumor vasculature and resulted in more leukocyte invasion. Thus, this innate cell type is responsive to IL-12 and is a powerful mediator of tumor suppression.},

abstract = {Identifying protein surface regions preferentially recognizable by antibodies (antigenic epitopes) is at the heart of new immuno-diagnostic reagent discovery and vaccine design, and computational methods for antigenic epitope prediction provide crucial means to serve this purpose. Many linear B-cell epitope prediction methods were developed, such as BepiPred, ABCPred, AAP, BCPred, BayesB, BEOracle/BROracle, and BEST, towards this goal. However, effective immunological research demands more robust performance of the prediction method than what the current algorithms could provide. In this work, a new method to predict linear antigenic epitopes is developed; Support Vector Machine has been utilized by combining the Tri-peptide similarity and Propensity scores (SVMTriP). Applied to non-redundant B-cell linear epitopes extracted from IEDB, SVMTriP achieves a sensitivity of 80.1{\%} and a precision of 55.2{\%} with a five-fold cross-validation. The AUC value is 0.702. The combination of similarity and propensity of tri-peptide subsequences can improve the prediction performance for linear B-cell epitopes. Moreover, SVMTriP is capable of recognizing viral peptides from a human protein sequence background. A web server based on our method is constructed for public use. The server and all datasets used in the current study are available at http://sysbio.unl.edu/SVMTriP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The findings of epidemiological studies, diagnostic tests, and comparative therapeutic trials are often presented in 2 x 2 tables. These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. METHODS: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. RESULTS: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure--yes/no and disease--yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2 x 3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship between the exposure and the disease is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2 x 2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing availability of genome sequences from many human pathogens, the production of complete proteomes remains at a bottleneck. To address this need, a high-throughput PCR recombination cloning and expression platform has been developed that allows hundreds of genes to be batch-processed by using ordinary laboratory procedures without robotics. The method relies on high-throughput amplification of each predicted ORF by using gene specific primers, followed by in vivo homologous recombination into a T7 expression vector. The proteins are expressed in an Escherichia coli-based cell-free in vitro transcription/translation system, and the crude reactions containing expressed proteins are printed directly onto nitrocellulose microarrays without purification. The protein microarrays are useful for determining the complete antigen-specific humoral immune-response profile from vaccinated or infected humans and animals. The system was verified by cloning, expressing, and printing a vaccinia virus proteome consisting of 185 individual viral proteins. The chips were used to determine Ab profiles in serum from vaccinia virus-immunized humans, primates, and mice. Human serum has high titers of anti-E. coli Abs that require blocking to unmask vaccinia-specific responses. Naive humans exhibit reactivity against a subset of 13 antigens that were not associated with vaccinia immunization. Naive mice and primates lacked this background reactivity. The specific profiles between the three species differed, although a common subset of antigens was reactive after vaccinia immunization. These results verify this platform as a rapid way to comprehensively scan humoral immunity from vaccinated or infected humans and animals.},

I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow {\&} Clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

In the current study, the proteome profile in unstimulated and stimulated whole, parotid and sublingual saliva was investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Saliva samples were structurally collected from ten examined and characterized healthy individuals during the exactly same conditions. The results demonstrated that different collection methods provide clear differences in the snapshot of the salivary proteome and also in the relative amount of specific proteins. The variable nature of the salivary proteome suggests that different approaches may have to be adopted when studying its composition or its possible role as an indicator for particular physiological states.

abstract = {Recent advances in cDNA and oligonucleotide DNA arrays have made it possible to measure the abundance of mRNA transcripts for many genes simultaneously. The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

Saliva, contains an abundance of proteins, offers an easy, inexpensive, safe, and non-invasive approach for disease detection, and possesses a high potential to revolutionize the diagnostics. Discovery of salivary biomarkers could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance.

The advancements of emerging proteomic techniques have benefited biomarker research to the point where saliva is now recognized as an excellent diagnostic medium for the detection of disease.

abstract = {The built environment (BE) and in particular kitchen environments harbor a remarkable microbial diversity, including pathogens. We analyzed the bacterial microbiome of used kitchen sponges by 454–pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH–CLSM). Pyrosequencing showed a relative dominance of Gammaproteobacteria within the sponge microbiota. Five of the ten most abundant OTUs were closely related to risk group 2 (RG2) species, previously detected in the BE and kitchen microbiome. Regular cleaning of sponges, indicated by their users, significantly affected the microbiome structure. Two of the ten dominant OTUs, closely related to the RG2-species Chryseobacterium hominis and Moraxella osloensis, showed significantly greater proportions in regularly sanitized sponges, thereby questioning such sanitation methods in a long term perspective. FISH–CLSM showed an ubiquitous distribution of bacteria within the sponge tissue, concentrating in internal cavities and on sponge surfaces, where biofilm–like structures occurred. Image analysis showed local densities of up to 5.4 * 10 10 cells per cm 3 , and confirmed the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria. Our study stresses and visualizes the role of kitchen sponges as microbiological hot spots in the BE, with the capability to collect and spread bacteria with a probable pathogenic potential. In industrialized countries, humans spend up to 90{\%} of their lifetime within built environments (BEs)},

abstract = {The determinants of binding specificities of peptide recognition domains and their evolution remain important problems in molecular systems biology. Here, we present a new methodology to analyze the coevolution between a domain and its ligands by combining high-throughput phage display with deep sequencing. First, from a library of PDZ domains with diversity introduced at ten positions in the binding site, we evolved domains for binding to 15 distinct peptide ligands. Interestingly, for a given peptide many different functional domains emerged, which exhibited only limited sequence homology, showing that many different binding sites can recognize a given peptide. Subsequently, we used peptide-phage libraries and deep sequencing to map the specificity profiles of these evolved domains at high resolution, and we found that the domains recognize their cognate peptides with high affinity but low specificity. Our analysis reveals two aspects of evolution of new binding specificities. First, we were able to identify some common features amongst domains raised against a common peptide. Second, our analysis suggests that cooperative interactions between multiple binding site residues lead to a diversity of binding profiles with considerable plasticity. The details of intramolecular cooperativity remain to be elucidated, but nonetheless, we have established a general methodology that can be used to explore protein evolution in a systematic yet rapid manner.},

abstract = {Background Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. Previously we introduced an intermediate approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution that does not rely on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript discovery. However, there were computational challenges involved with performing base-resolution analyses in large numbers of samples at genome scale. Results Here we describe a new version of the derfinder software that allows for: (1) genome- scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) flexible statistical modeling, including multi-group and time course analyses, and (3) a new, computationally efficient approach to re-analysis at base resolution called expressed-region analysis. We also introduce functionality for annotating and plotting base-resolution data to identify artifacts and confirm results. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the developing human brain to illustrate the types of analyses and results possible using derfinder. Conclusions Single-base and expressed-region RNA-sequencing analysis provides compromise be- tween full transcript reconstruction and gene-level analysis. derfinder is software designed to identify, visualize, and interpret differentially expressed regions.

abstract = {Therapeutic numbers of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are key effectors in successful adoptive immunotherapy. However, efficient and reproducible methods to meet the qualification remain poor. To address this issue, we designed the artificial antigen-presenting cell (aAPC) system based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). A modified emulsion method was used for the preparation of PLGA particles encapsulating interleukin-2 (IL-2). Biotinylated molecular ligands for recognition and co-stimulation of T cells were attached to the particle surface through the binding of avidin-biotin. These formed the aAPC system. The function of aAPCs in the proliferation of specific CTLs against human Flu antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and MTT staining methods. Finally, we successfully prepared this suitable aAPC system. The results show that IL-2 is released from aAPCs in a sustained manner over 30 days. This dramatically improves the stimulatory capacity of this system as compared to the effect of exogenous addition of cytokine. In addition, our aAPCs promote the proliferation of Flu antigen-specific CTLs more effectively than the autologous cellular APCs. Here, this aAPC platform is proved to be suitable for expansion of human antigen-specific T cells.},

Tandem mass spectrometry may represent a detection method capable of alleviating many of the flaws inherent to immunoassays.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray data must be background corrected to remove the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments. RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression is known, eight different background correction alternatives are compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data.

abstract = {Identifying protein surface regions preferentially recognizable by antibodies (antigenic epitopes) is at the heart of new immuno-diagnostic reagent discovery and vaccine design, and computational methods for antigenic epitope prediction provide crucial means to serve this purpose. Many linear B-cell epitope prediction methods were developed, such as BepiPred, ABCPred, AAP, BCPred, BayesB, BEOracle/BROracle, and BEST, towards this goal. However, effective immunological research demands more robust performance of the prediction method than what the current algorithms could provide. In this work, a new method to predict linear antigenic epitopes is developed; Support Vector Machine has been utilized by combining the Tri-peptide similarity and Propensity scores (SVMTriP). Applied to non-redundant B-cell linear epitopes extracted from IEDB, SVMTriP achieves a sensitivity of 80.1{\%} and a precision of 55.2{\%} with a five-fold cross-validation. The AUC value is 0.702. The combination of similarity and propensity of tri-peptide subsequences can improve the prediction performance for linear B-cell epitopes. Moreover, SVMTriP is capable of recognizing viral peptides from a human protein sequence background. A web server based on our method is constructed for public use. The server and all datasets used in the current study are available at http://sysbio.unl.edu/SVMTriP.},

abstract = {The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression ("reverse immunology"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.},

abstract = {CTL with optimal effector function play critical roles in mediating protection against various intracellular infections and cancer. However, individuals may exhibit suppressive immune microenvironment and, in contrast to activating CTL, their autologous antigen presenting cells may tend to tolerize or anergize antigen specific CTL. As a result, although still in the experimental phase, CTL-based adoptive immunotherapy has evolved to become a promising treatment for various diseases such as cancer and virus infections. In initial experiments ex vivo expanded CMV (cytomegalovirus) specific CTL have been used for treatment of CMV infection in immunocompromised allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients. While it is common to have life-threatening CMV viremia in these patients, none of the patients receiving expanded CTL develop CMV related illness, implying the anti-CMV immunity is established by the adoptively transferred CTL. Promising results have also been observed for melanoma and may be extended to other types of cancer. While there are many ways to ex vivo stimulate and expand human CTL, current approaches are restricted by the cost and technical limitations. For example, the current gold standard is based on the use of autologous DC. This requires each patient to donate a significant number of leukocytes and is also very expensive and laborious. Moreover, detailed in vitro characterization of DC expanded CTL has revealed that these have only suboptimal effector function. Here we present a highly efficient aAPC based system for ex vivo expansion of human CMV specific CTL for adoptive immunotherapy (Figure 1). The aAPC were made by coupling cell sized magnetic beads with human HLA-A2-Ig dimer and anti-CD28mAb. Once aAPC are made, they can be loaded with various peptides of interest, and remain functional for months. In this report, aAPC were loaded with a dominant peptide from CMV, pp65 (NLVPMVATV). After culturing purified human CD8(+) CTL from a healthy donor with aAPC for one week, CMV specific CTL can be increased dramatically in specificity up to 98{\%} (Figure 2) and amplified more than 10,000 fold. If more CMV-specific CTL are required, further expansion can be easily achieved by repetitive stimulation with aAPC. Phenotypic and functional characterization shows these expanded cells have an effector-memory phenotype and make significant amounts of both TNF$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$ (Figure 3).},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the introduction of microarray technology has had a profound impact on gene expression research. The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

The transcriptional and effector programs of ILC strikingly resemble those of the various T-helper (Th) cell fates (that is, Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22). ILC are involved in protecting the mucosal borders by producing tissue protective factors. More recently, evidence has been provided that inappropriately activated ILC can be drivers of various inflammatory disorders. Here, we will highlight recent developments in our understanding of the transcriptional and developmental programs controlling ILC specification and fate decisions. We will also review the roles assigned to ILC in protecting barriers and in promoting inflammatory diseases. Finally, we will outline how the power of ILC may be harnessed for clinical application, and how interference with ILC function may be used as a new strategy to treat inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {The drug delivery system based on supramolecular vesicles that were self-assembled by a novel host-guest inclusion complex between a water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6) and hydrophobic ferrocene derivative in water has been developed. The inclusion complexation between WP6 and ferrocene derivative in water was studied by (1)H NMR, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, which showed a high binding constant of (1.27 ± 0.42) × 10(5) M(-1) with 1:1 binding stoichiometry. This resulting inclusion complex could self-assemble into supramolecular vesicles that displayed a significant pH-responsive behavior in aqueous solution, which were investigated by fluorescent probe technique, dynamic laser scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the drug loading and in vitro drug release studies demonstrated that these supramolecular vesicles were able to encapsulate mitoxantrone (MTZ) to achieve MTZ-loaded vesicles, which particularly showed rapid MTZ release at low-pH environment. More importantly, the cellular uptake of these pH-responsive MTZ-loaded vesicles by cancer cells was observed by living cell imaging techniques, and their cytotoxicity assay indicated that unloaded vesicles had low toxicity to normal cells, which could dramatically reduce the toxicity of MTZ upon loading of MTZ. Meanwhile, MTZ-loaded vesicles exhibited comparable anticancer activity in vitro as free MTZ to cancer cells under examined conditions. This study suggests that such supramolecular vesicles have great potential as controlled drug delivery systems.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This review of the EUROCARE-4 results attempts to separate out the early and late mortality effects contributing to the widely reported poorer 5-year survival rates for cancer patients in the United Kingdom compared with other European countries for 26 cancer sites. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cancer in 1996-1999 in 23 European countries were included in the analyses. Comparison of 1-year, 5-year and 5|1-year (i.e. only including those patients who had survived to 1 year) survival estimates between data for England and the 'European average' was undertaken. This analysis was to highlight the relative contribution of early diagnosis, using 1-year survival as a proxy measure, on 5-year survival for the different sites of cancer. Three groups of cancer sites were identified according to whether the survival differences at 1, 5 and 5|1-years were statistically significant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer showed significantly poorer 1- and 5-year survival estimates in England, but the 5|1-year survival figure was not significantly different. Thus, successful initiatives around awareness and early detection could eradicate the survival gap. In contrast, the 5|1-year survival estimates remained significantly worse for lung, colorectal and prostate cancers, showing that although early detection could make some difference, late effects such as treatment and management of the patients were also influencing long-term outcome differences between England and Europe.},

Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.

abstract = {Saliva is an important body fluid containing a complex mixture of proteins, peptides and other substances. These are not only important in maintaining the health of the oral cavity but also may yield information about oral and systemic disease. Comprehensive analysis and identification of the proteomic content of human saliva may contribute to the understanding of oral pathophysiology and provide a foundation for the recognition of potential biomarkers of human disease. The collection of saliva samples is non-invasive, safe, and inexpensive. It seems likely that testing methods can be developed which can be used in general medical or dental practice. However, it is important to realize that the collection of saliva must be carefully controlled. In this paper we review the progress in the analysis of the human salivary proteome and summarise the diagnostic possibilities that have been explored. The precautions in collecting saliva, and some of the factors which would have to be considered if a diagnostic test were to be generally adopted are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Experiments conducted with the enzyme in bulk solution are shown to be in good agreement with theory. Three salts, made of the cations tetrathiafulvalinium (TTF+), N-methylphenazinium or quinolinium with the anion tetracyanoquinodimethanide (TCNQ−) had the lowest background currents and were used to make membrane sensors for glucose. Analysis of the variation of current with glucose concentration identified the rate limiting processes as transport of gluycose through the membrane and electrochemical kinetics under unsaturated and saturated conditions respectively. The electrochemical rate constants for these three materials were all greater than 10−2 cm s−1. TTF+TCNQ− is the material of choice and linear calibration plots were obtained for glucose concentrations between 50 $\mu$mol dm−3 and 10 mmol dm−3.},

However, the size and charge of most nanoparticles preclude their efficient clearance from the body as intact nanoparticles. Without such clearance or their biodegradation into biologically benign components, toxicity is potentially amplified and radiological imaging is hindered. Using intravenously administered quantum dots in rodents as a model system, we have precisely defined the requirements for renal filtration and urinary excretion of inorganic, metal-containing nanoparticles. Zwitterionic or neutral organic coatings prevented adsorption of serum proteins, which otherwise increased hydrodynamic diameter by {\textgreater}15 nm and prevented renal excretion. A final hydrodynamic diameter {\textless}5.5 nm resulted in rapid and efficient urinary excretion and elimination of quantum dots from the body. This study provides a foundation for the design and development of biologically targeted nanoparticles for biomedical applications.},

We show here that LTi cells are part of a larger family of proinflammatory ROR$\gamma$t(+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that differentiate from distinct fetal liver ROR$\gamma$t(+) precursors. The fate of ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs is determined by mouse age, and after birth, favors the generation of cells involved in intestinal homeostasis and defense. Contrary to ROR$\gamma$t(+) T cells, however, ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs develop in the absence of microbiota. Our study indicates that ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs evolve to preempt intestinal colonization by microbial symbionts.},

abstract = {Analysis of data from complementary DNA microarray experiments is an area of intense research. Options include models at the gene level or at the global level, the latter combining information from all of the profiled genes. In general, a joint analysis is expected to be more powerful than gene-specific analyses. Global analysis of microarray data requires fitting a model that jointly performs data normalization and analyses. The objective of this study was to assess the optimality of alternative models for data normalization and analysis in an experiment to identify differentially expressed genes between 2 muscles in Avile{\~{n}}a Negra Ib{\'{e}}rica calves. Three major groups of models were explored according to several aspects including spatial arrangement of spots, other technical sources of variation such as dye effects, assumptions related to effects included in the model, and gene-specific effects. In addition, 3 sources of heterogeneity of residual variance were investigated. All models were compared by Bayes factors and cross-validation predictive densities. The model that included array-block, dye, muscle, and array-dye as systematic effects and all gene-related components as random effects was the best model for normalization and analysis of these data under heterogeneity of residual variances. Furthermore, level of intensity seemed to be the major source of heteroscedasticity for all models investigated. Such models rendered the best goodness of fit without compromising the predictive ability. The best model also provided the best performance to detect genes differentially expressed with the lowest false discovery rate. The large differences found for the model comparison criteria across models indicate the importance of defining the factors that more accurately account for experiment-wide variability to ensure correct inference on differential expression of genes. Our results also illustrate the importance of the experimental setup to account for possible sources of bias in the detection of differentially expressed genes.},

abstract = {Genome projects now generate large-scale data often produced at various time points by different laboratories using multiple platforms. This increases the potential for batch effects. Currently there are several batch evaluation methods like principal component analysis (PCA; mostly based on visual inspection), and sometimes they fail to reveal all of the underlying batch effects. These methods can also lead to the risk of unintentionally correcting biologically interesting factors attributed to batch effects. Here we propose a novel statistical method, finding batch effect (findBATCH), to evaluate batch effect based on probabilistic principal component and covariates analysis (PPCCA). The same framework also provides a new approach to batch correction, correcting batch effect (correctBATCH), which we have shown to be a better approach to traditional PCA-based correction. We demonstrate the utility of these methods using two different examples (breast and colorectal cancers) by merging gene expression data from different studies after diagnosing and correcting for batch effects and retaining the biological effects. These methods, along with conventional visual inspection-based PCA, are available as a part of an R package exploring batch effect (exploBATCH;

abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

Here we report caloxin 1A1-a novel peptide inhibitor (Ki=100 $\mu$M) of plasma membrane Ca 2+-pump-obtained by screening a cysteine bridge-constrained random peptide library for binding to the first extracellular domain of plasma membrane Ca2+-pump. Dithiothreitol removed the inhibition indicating that the constraint imposed by the cysteine bridge is required for the inhibition. Caloxin 1A1 also inhibited the fast twitch sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+-Mg2+-ATPase although weakly. Glutathione dimers (containing a cysteine bridge) inhibited the Ca2+-Mg 2+-ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-Mg 2+-ATPase, but not that of plasma membrane Ca2+-pump. Caloxin 1A1 stabilised Ca2+-dependent formation of the acid stable 140-kDa acylphosphate which is a partial reaction of this enzyme. Thus caloxin 1A1 inhibits the plasma membrane Ca2+-pump by perturbing the first extracellular domain indicating that the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 play a role in its reaction cycle. This finding is consistent with rearrangements that occur in transmembrane helices 1 and 2 during reaction cycle of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-pump.

Absorption spectrum has distinct peaks at 380 and 457 nm, excitation spectrum at 373 and 447 nm, and emission spectrum at 530 and 562 nm. The pH correlation of enzyme activity and catalytic characteristics in various buffer systems (phosphate (pH 5.0-9.0), citrate (pH 3.0-5.0), citrate-phosphate (pH 3.0-9.0), and universal (pH 3.0-9.0)) were registered. It was determined that the GOx is the most efficiently interacting with substrate (glucose) in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 with k cat/K m = 21,825 M(-1) s(-1). Interaction of several different redox mediators (9,10-phenantroline-5,6-dione, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate, ferrocene, ferrocenecarboxylic acid, $\alpha$-methylferrocenemethanol, ferrocenecarboxaldehyde) with GOx from P. funiculosum was investigated by evaluation of the difference in fluorescence emission intensity of FAD(oxidized) and FADH2(reduced) forms.

The aim is to present a review of the literature on human saliva composition, flow rates and some of the health benefits of saliva, with emphasis on studies from our laboratory that have looked at effects of age and age-related diseases on saliva output and composition. Data. Saliva influences oral health both through its non-specific physico-chemical properties, as well as through more specific effects. The proline-rich proteins, statherin and the histatins are salivary proteins that influence calcium phosphate chemistry, initial plaque formation and candida infection. Increases or decreases in mastication may affect saliva output. Our cross-sectional studies of saliva in a large population-based study cohort (N=1130) indicate that there is an age-related decline in saliva output for unstimulated whole, stimulated parotid, unstimulated submandibular/sublingual and stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva, as well as some compositional alterations in anti-microbial and other proteins. Some of these alterations also appear to be specific for certain age-related medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. Conclusions. These studies and data presented confirm the importance of saliva in maintaining a healthy oral environment; the practitioner is encouraged to consider saliva output and medical conditions that may compromise it as part of routine dental treatment planning. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

No classifier or single gene discriminating the group of primary tumours from those of the lymph node metastases could be identified. Also, in a series of 295 breast tumours, no classifier predicting lymph node metastasis could be developed. However, subtle differences in the expression of genes involved in extracellular-matrix organisation and growth factor signalling are detected in individual pairs of matching primary and metastatic tumours. Surprisingly, however, different sets of these genes are either up- or downregulated in lymph node metastases. Our data suggest that breast carcinomas do not use a shared gene set to accomplish lymph node metastasis.},

abstract = {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify changes in expression between different biological states. Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12{\%}, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84{\%} by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {The vesicle to micelle transition which results in the interaction of the Triton X-100 surfactant with phosphatidylcholine vesicles was studied by means of dynamic light scattering (at different reading angles) and by freeze-fracture electron microscopy techniques. Vesicle solubilization was produced by the direct formation of mixed micelles without the formation of complex intermediate aggregates. Thus, vesicle to micelle transformation was mainly governed by the progressive formation of mixed micelles within the bilayer. A subsequent separation of these micelles from the liposome surface (vesicle perforation by the formation of surfactant-stabilized holes on the vesicle surface) led to a complete solubilization of liposomes.},

abstract = {Today nanotechnology is finding growing applications in industry, biology, and medicine. The clear benefits of using nanosized products in various biological and medical applications are often challenged by concerns about the lack of adequate data regarding their toxicity. One area of interest involves the interactions between nanoparticles and the components of the immune system. Nanoparticles can be engineered to either avoid immune system recognition or specifically inhibit or enhance the immune responses. We review herein reported observations on nanoparticle-mediated immunostimulation and immunosuppression, focusing on possible theories regarding how manipulation of particle physicochemical properties can influence their interaction with immune cells to attain desirable immunomodulation and avoid undesirable immunotoxicity.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays open up a broad new horizon for investigators interested in studying the genetic determinants of disease. The high throughput nature of these arrays, where differential expression for thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously, creates an enormous wealth of information, but also poses a challenge for data analysis because of the large multiple testing problem involved. The solution has generally been to focus on optimizing false-discovery rates while sacri ficing power. The drawback of this approach is that more subtle expression differences will be missed that might give investigators more insight into the genetic environment necessary for a diseaseprocess to take hold. We introduce a new method for detecting differentially expressed genes based on a high-dimensional model selectiontechnique, Bayesian ANOVA for microarrays (BAM), which strikes a balance between false rejections and false nonrejections. The basisof the new approach involves a weighted average of generalized ridge regression estimates that provides the bene fits of using shrinkage estimation combined with model averaging. A simple graphical tool based on the amount of shrinkage is developed to visualize the trade-offbetween low false-discovery rates and finding more genes. Simulations are used to illustrate BAM' s performance, and the method is appliedto a large database of colon cancer gene expression data. Our working hypothesis in the colon cancer analysis is that large differential expressions may not be the only ones contributing to metastasis—  in fact, moderate changes in expression of genes may be involved in modifying the genetic environment to a suf ficient extent for metastasis to occur. A functional biological analysis of gene effects found by BAM, but not other false-discovery-based approaches, lends support to this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Although murine tumor cells have been transfected to express a multitude of different cytokines and shown to be rejected in vivo, it is unclear which of these factors might be useful to facilitate tumor Ag immunization schemes. A study of the normal immune mechanisms involved in tumor rejection when it naturally occurs should reveal critical signals for generation of antitumor CTL in vivo. The highly transfectable variant of P815, P1.HTR, was found to be rejected in the hind footpads by approximately one-third of syngeneic DBA/2 mice. Analysis of draining popliteal lymph nodes revealed a large influx of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in all mice, indicating that a failure to reject was not due to the complete absence of an inflammatory response. However, although IL-2 and IL-3 were produced by lymph node cells from all mice, only approximately one-third generated a high IFN-gamma response. IL-4 was not detected. To explore a role for IL-12 in the induction of the IFN-gamma-producing phenotype, a histidine-tagged IL-12 fusion protein was expressed in mammalian cells and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography, and a rabbit antiserum was produced. Neutralization of IL-12 in vivo eliminated the high IFN-gamma response and prevented rejection of P1.HTR tumors and also of a more immunogenic tum- variant of P815, P198. Conversely, exogenous IL-12 delivered early during challenge with P1.HTR cells induced high IFN-gamma production and resulted in tumor rejection in most mice. Therefore, endogenous IL-12 is vital for the rejection of these tumors when it naturally occurs, supporting a role for exogenous administration of this cytokine to favor a Th1-like phenotype in the immunotherapy of cancer. },

abstract = {Patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) harbor antibodies reactive against self-antigens expressed at the surface of keratinocytes, primarily desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and, to a lesser extent, Dsg1. Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development.},

abstract = {To address the need for a universal system to assess health status, we previously described a method termed “immunosignaturing” which splays the entire humoral antibody repertoire across a peptide microarray. Two important issues relative to the potential broad use of immunosignatures are sample preparation and stability. In the present study, we compared the immunosignatures developed from serum, plasma, saliva, and antibodies eluted from blood dried onto filter paper. We found that serum and plasma provide identical immunosignatures. Immunosignatures derived from dried blood also correlated well with those from nondried serum from the same individual. Immunosignatures derived from dried blood were capable of distinguishing na{\"{i}}ve mice from those infected with influenza virus. Saliva was applied to the arrays, and the IgA immunosignature correlated strongly with that from dried blood. Finally, we demonstrate that dried blood retains immunosignature information even when exposed to high temperature. This work expands the potential diagnostic uses for immunosignatures. These features suggest that different forms of archival samples can be used for diagnosis development and that in prospective studies samples can be easily procured.},

abstract = {The calculation of protein–ligand binding free energies is an important goal in the field of computational chemistry. Applying path-sampling methods for this purpose involves calculating the associated potential of mean force (PMF) and gives insight into the binding free energy along the binding process. Without a priori knowledge about the binding path, sampling reversible binding can be difficult to achieve. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the distancefield (DF) as a reaction coordinate for such calculations. DF is a grid-based method in which the shortest distance between the binding site and a ligand is determined avoiding routes that pass through the protein. Combining this reaction coordinate with Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD) allows for the reversible binding of the ligand to the protein. A comparison is made between umbrella sampling using regular distance restraints and HREMD with DF restraints to study aspirin binding to the protein phospholipase A2. Although the free energies of binding are similar for both methods, the increased sampling with HREMD has a significant influence on the shape of the PMF. A remarkable agreement between the calculated binding free energies from the PMF and the experimental estimate is obtained.},

Great signal amplification was achieved since liposome could encapsulate large amount of reporter molecules and GNPs could provide large active surface. Under optimized conditions, with sandwich type format, a linear range of AFP from 0.005 to 0.2 pg/mL and an extremely low detection limit of 0.001 pg/mL was obtained, much lower than that in previous reports.

abstract = {The Neyman–Pearson lemma provides a simple procedure for optimally testing a single hypothesis when the null and alternative distributions are known. This result has played a major role in the development of significance testing strategies that are used in practice. Most of the work extending single-testing strategies to multiple tests has focused on formulating and estimating newtypes of significance measures, such as the false discovery rate.These methods tend to be based on p-values that are calculated from each test individually, ignoring informa- tion from the other tests. I show here that one can improve the overall performance of multiple significance tests by borrowing information across all the tests when assessing the relative sig- nificance of each one, rather than calculating p-values for each test individually. The ‘optimal discovery procedure' is introduced, which shows how to maximize the number of expected true positive results for each fixed number of expected false positive results. The optimality that is achieved by this procedure is shown to be closely related to optimality in terms of the false discovery rate. The optimal discovery procedure motivates a new approach to testing multiple hypotheses, especially when the tests are related. As a simple example, a new simultaneous procedure for testing several normal means is defined; this is surprisingly demonstrated to out- perform the optimal single-test procedure, showing that a method which is optimal for single tests may no longer be optimal for multiple tests. Connections to other concepts in statistics are discussed, including Stein's paradox, shrinkage estimation and the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with commonly used quality criteria. RESULTS: We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general. CONCLUSION: The multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the "correct" parameter settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition. All data as well as our evaluation scripts are available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap.},

The performance of RGD-modified PLL-g-PEG copolymers was analyzed in protein adsorption and cell culture assays. These coatings efficiently blocked the adsorption of serum proteins to Nb(2)O(5) and tissue culture polystyrene while specifically supporting attachment and spreading of human dermal fibroblasts.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purported existence of "large pores" in the glomerular capillary wall has been derived primarily from studies using dextrans and Ficolls. Systematic studies using high molecular weight proteins have not been performed. One of the difficulties is that recent studies have demonstrated that albumin and other proteins undergo degradation during renal passage. Our study took into account this renal degradation in measuring the fractional clearance of various high molecular weight proteins (the hydrodynamic radii range was between 48 to 70 A).

METHODS: Fractional clearances of tritium-labeled proteins were measured using ALZET osmotic pumps, which are designed to release a slow continuous infusion of tracer. Blood and urine collections were taken at 24-hour intervals over seven days and were counted for radioactivity, and glomerular filtration rate was measured by a creatinine assay.

RESULTS: Steady-state levels of [3H]protein in plasma were obtained by day 6. The [3H]proteins in the plasma showed no degradation. The fractional clearances (mean +/- sd, N = 5) of the various proteins were albumin (radius = 36 A; 0.0023 +/- 0.0009), transferrin (48 A; 0.0046 +/- 0.0007), lactoperoxidase (58 A; 0. 0045 +/- 0.0005), immunoglobulin G (62 A; 0.0043 +/- 0.0009), lactate dehydrogenase (64 A; 0.0041 +/- 0.0009), and glucose oxidase (70 A; 0.0036 +/- 0.0011).

CONCLUSIONS: These values suggest a weak dependence of fractional clearance on size-selective filtration, except for albumin, which undergoes a specific type of postglomerular processing. The fractional clearances were higher than expected from previous data on dextrans and Ficolls of equivalent hydrodynamic radius, and thus demonstrate that "large pores" may already exist in normal glomerular capillary walls.},

abstract = {Microglia are the principal immune cells of the brain. In Alzheimer disease, these brain mononuclear phagocytes are recruited from the blood and accumulate in senile plaques. However, the role of microglia in Alzheimer disease has not been resolved. Microglia may be neuroprotective by phagocytosing amyloid-beta (Abeta), but their activation and the secretion of neurotoxins may also cause neurodegeneration. Ccr2 is a chemokine receptor expressed on microglia, which mediates the accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes at sites of inflammation. Here we show that Ccr2 deficiency accelerates early disease progression and markedly impairs microglial accumulation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease (Tg2576). Alzheimer disease mice deficient in Ccr2 accumulated Abeta earlier and died prematurely, in a manner that correlated with Ccr2 gene dosage, indicating that absence of early microglial accumulation leads to decreased Abeta clearance and increased mortality. Thus, Ccr2-dependent microglial accumulation plays a protective role in the early stages of Alzheimer disease by promoting Abeta clearance.},

abstract = {In hypothesis testing, statistical significance is typically based on calculations involving p-values and Type I error rates. A p-value calculated from a single statistical hypothesis test can be used to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis. The upper threshold applied to the p-value in making this determination (often 5{\%} in the scienti c literature) determines the Type I error rate; i.e., the probability of making a Type I error when the null hypothesis is true. Multiple hypothesis testing is concerned with testing several statistical hypotheses simultaneously. Defining statistical significance is a more complex problem in this setting.},

@article{Ivarsson2014,
abstract = {The human proteome contains a plethora of short linear motifs (SLiMs) that serve as binding interfaces for modular protein domains. Such interactions are crucial for signaling and other cellular processes, but are difficult to detect because of their low to moderate affinities. Here we developed a dedicated approach, proteomic peptide-phage display (ProP-PD), to identify domain-SLiM interactions. Specifically, we generated phage libraries containing all human and viral C-terminal peptides using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. With these libraries we screened the nine PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains of human Densin-180, Erbin, Scribble, and Disks large homolog 1 for peptide ligands. We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins $\beta$-PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit $\alpha$-2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-$\mu$M range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions. The method can be extended to interrogate all potential eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral SLiMs and we suggest it will be a highly valuable approach for studying cellular and pathogen-host protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {We report a novel and very simple method for the detection of proteolytically-active prostate specific antigen (PSA) at a very low concentration using a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of magnetic beads conjugated with peptide. The application of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allows real-time optical characterization of the constructed recognition monolayer. This set-up is also capable of rapid monitoring of PSA samples through an instantaneous detection of medium refractive index shift induced by the enzymatic cleavage of the peptide and the dissociation of free magnetic beads. The results showed the ability of our SPR sensor to detect PSA within a short time (few minutes to 30 min) with high sensitivity (100 pg/ml) and specificity. Thanks to the elimination of washing and blocking steps, as well as the signal amplification and labeling procedures, this approach can be implemented in other miniaturized configurations such as screen printed electrode and biochip array amenable to low-cost point-of-care devices.},

Here we present formulae for determining sample sizes to achieve a variety of experimental goals, including class comparison and the development of prognostic markers. Results are derived which describe the impact of pooling, technical replicates and dye-swap arrays on sample size requirements. These results are shown to depend on the relative sizes of different sources of variability. A variety of common types of experimental situations and designs used with single-label and dual-label microarrays are considered. We discuss procedures for controlling the false discovery rate. Our calculations are based on relatively simple yet realistic statistical models for the data, and provide straightforward sample size calculation formulae.},

A newly formed tumor microenvironment elicits the immune system and, as a result, a humoral immune response takes place. Although the tumor antigens are undetectable in sera at the early stage of tumorigenesis, the nature of an antibody amplification response to antigens makes tumor-associated autoantibodies as promising early biomarkers in cancer diagnosis. Moreover, the recent development of proteomic techniques that make neo-epitopes of tumor-associated autoantigens discovered concomitantly has opened a new area of 'immuno-proteomics', which presents tumor-associated autoantibody signatures and confers information to redefine the process of tumorigenesis. In this article, the strategies recently used to identify and validate serum autoantibodies are outlined and tumor-associated antigens suggested until now as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in various tumor types are reviewed. Also, the meaning of autoantibody signatures and their clinical utility in personalized medicine are discussed.},

abstract = {Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), one of the indications of possible prostate malignancy, is used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Herein, we develop a new homogeneous potentiometric immunoassay for sensitive detection of low-concentration PSA without the need of sample separation and washing step. Two nanostructures including positively charged polyethyleneimine-poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) (PEI-PSAA) nanospheres and negatively charged gold nanoparticles conjugated with anti-PSA antibody (Ab-AuNP) were first synthesized by using mulsifier-free emulsion copolymerization and wet chemistry method, respectively. Thereafter, the as-prepared PEI-PSAA was used as a pseudo hapten for the construction of immunosensing probe based on an electrostatic interaction between PEI-PSAA and Ab-AuNP. Upon target introduction, the added PSA competed with PEI-PASS for Ab-AuNP based on a specific antigen-antibody interaction, and displaced Ab-AuNP from PEI-PASS. The dissociated PEI-PASS was captured through the negatively charged Nafion- modified electrode, thereby resulting in the change of membrane potential. The fabrication process was characterized by using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS) technique. Under optimal conditions, the output signal was indirectly proportional to the concentration of target PSA in the sample and exhibited a dynamic range from 0.1 to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.04 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6.8 and 7.5{\%}, respectively. In addition, the methodology was evaluated for analysis of 12 clinical serum samples and showed good accordance between the results obtained by the developed immunosensing protocol and a commercialized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.},

abstract = {Current flu vaccines are based on killed or attenuated virus vaccines that must be altered each year to include the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from a strain of virus predicted to predominate in the coming year. A vaccine that could protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B would be a major asset in the fight against flu-related mortality and morbidity. To support development of such a vaccine, we have developed a Flu Multiplex Assay based on a Luminex?? platform to assess serum antibody levels to two conserved peptides derived from influenza A (M2 protein) and influenza B (hemagglutinin protein). The peptides were synthesized with a biotin label and subsequently coupled to two different LumAvidin??? microspheres. We then tested various sera against both types of peptide in the multiplex assay format. The data show that sera from Rhesus macaques immunized with a single peptide react only with the homologous peptide while Rhesus macaques immunized with both peptides respond well to both peptides. Additionally, we were able to specifically compete reactivity to both peptides. We have tested serial bleeds from 100 pediatric patients at ages ranging from 16 to 56??weeks as well as single bleeds from over 100 healthy adults. No overall trend in titer relative to pediatric age was detected. Both demographics exhibited a minimal response to either the A/M2 or B/HA
                        0 peptides. However, the average titer for the pediatric serum samples was significantly lower than that found in the adult population.

The assay will be used to support clinical vaccine trials of a bivalent peptide vaccine. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Recombinant viral or virus-like particles offer new tools for vaccine development. This study investigated hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) capsids and RNA phage Qbeta coats as carriers of a foreign epitope to induce antibody responses in mice. HBcAg capsids were shown to induce T cell-independent (TI) antibodies. We found that these particles behave as antigen-specific TI type 1 (TI-1) Ag comparable to other rigidly structured viruses. When a 5-aa long epitope of the pre-S1 domain of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was introduced into the optimal position of the HBc molecule, it also behaved as a TI-1 Ag. Best efficiency of the antibody response to the foreign epitope was achieved by a compensatory deletion after the epitope to retain the regular structure of the HBcAg capsid with a highly repetitive superficial exposition of the foreign epitope. For recombinant Qbeta phage coats, a much more efficient antibody response to the foreign epitope was achieved when the foreign epitope was expressed repetitively on a particulate derivate of Qbeta phage coats. Thus, recombinant virus particles are suitable vaccine carriers for the introduction of foreign B cell epitopes, if precise structural requirements are fulfilled.},

A typical microarray experiment can produce millions of data points, raising serious problems of data reduction, and simultaneous inference. We consider one such experiment in which oligonucleotide arrays were employed to assess the genetic effects of ionizing radiation on seven thousand human genes. A simple nonparametric empirical Bayes model is introduced, which is used to guide the efficient reduction of the data to a single summary statistic per gene, and also to make simultaneous inferences concerning which genes were affected by the radiation. Although our focus is on one specific experiment, the proposed methods can be applied quite generally. The empirical Bayes inferences are closely related to the frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) criterion.},

abstract = {Intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and oligoclonal IgG bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the antigen specificities remain enigmatic. Our study is the first investigating the autoantibody repertoire in paired serum and CSF samples from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and other neurological diseases by the use of high-density peptide microarrays. Protein sequences of 45 presumed MS autoantigens (e.g.MOG, MBP, and MAG) were represented on the microarrays by overlapping 15mer peptides. IgG reactivities were screened against a total of 3991 peptides, including also selected viral epitopes. The measured antibody reactivities were highly individual but correlated for matched serum and CSF samples. We found 54 peptides to be recognized significantly more often by serum or CSF antibodies from MS patients compared with controls (pvalues {\textless}0.05). The results for RRMS and PPMS clearly overlapped. However, PPMS patients presented a broader peptide-antibody signature. The highest signals were detected for a peptide mapping to a region of the Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA1 (amino acids 392-411), which is homologous to the N-terminal part of human crystallin alpha-B. Our data confirmed several known MS-associated antigens and epitopes, and they delivered additional potential linear epitopes, which await further validation. The peripheral and intrathecal humoral immune response in MS is polyspecific and includes antibodies that are also found in serum of patients with other diseases. Further studies are required to assess the pathogenic relevance of autoreactive and anti-EBNA1 antibodies as well as their combinatorial value as biomarkers for MS.},

abstract = {Glycan-based suspension array (SGA) is an "in-house" developed multi-target immunoassay, employing commercially available fluorescent microbeads as a solid support for unique chemically synthesized glycopolymers which capture naturally occurring human anti-glycan antibodies. SGA is a sensitive and reliable tool for the high-throughput screening of anti-glycan antibody alterations characteristic for a vast number of human diseases including cancer. However, unspecific background binding, for instance binding of non-target antibodies, is a common obstacle in such immunoassays. In an attempt to reduce unspecific background binding of serum (or plasma) antibodies, we prepared glycosylated microbeads modified with linear poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs) of different lengths. We compared several kinds of PEG modifications: (a) partial side-chain substitution of glycopolymers by PEGs of different lengths, (b) end-point addition of biotin-linked PEGs to glycopolymer-coupled beads, and (c) linking of heterobifunctional PEGs to the bead surface prior to glycopolymer immobilization. Among the various modifications investigated, the direct modification of the bead surface with linear heterobifunctional PEGs, consisting of 23- and 60. PEG-units significantly reduced the background binding. The end-point addition of biotin-linked PEGs, especially in the case of PEG consisting from 50. PEG-units, helped to repel non-target binding caused by endogenous biotin. We observed unspecific binding predominantly for antibodies of IgG but of IgM class. The novel design of fluorescent microbeads allows the detection of human anti-glycan antibodies with increased specificity and opens new horizons for practical application of SGA as a diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {Motivation: Microarray techniques provide a valuable way of characterizing the molecular nature of disease. Unfortunately expense and limited specimen availability often lead to studies with small sample sizes. This makes accurate estimation of variability difficult, since variance estimates made on a gene by gene basis will have few degrees of freedom, and the assumption that all genes share equal variance is unlikely to be true.Results: We propose a model by which the within gene variances are drawn from an inverse gamma distribution, whose parameters are estimated across all genes. This results in a test statistic that is a minor variation of those used in standard linear models. We demonstrate that the model assumptions are valid on experimental data, and that the model has more power than standard tests to pick up large changes in expression, while not increasing the rate of false positives.Availability: This method is incorporated into BRB-ArrayTools version 3.0 (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html).Supplementary material: ftp://linus.nci.nih.gov/pub/techreport/RVM{\_}supplement.pdf},

abstract = {Consensus clustering (CC) has been adopted for unsupervised class discovery in many genomic studies. It calculates how frequently two samples are grouped together in repeated clustering runs, and uses the resulting pairwise "consensus rates" for visual demonstration that clusters exist, for comparing cluster stability, and for estimating the optimal cluster number (K). However, the sensitivity and specificity of CC have not been systemically assessed. Through simulations we find that CC is able to divide randomly generated unimodal data into apparently stable clusters for a range of K, essentially reporting chance partitions of cluster-less data. For data with known structure, the common implementations of CC perform poorly in identifying the true K. These results suggest that CC should be applied and interpreted with caution. We found that a new metric based on CC, the proportion of ambiguously clustered pairs (PAC), infers K equally or more reliably than similar methods in simulated data with known K. Our overall approach involves the use of realistic null distributions based on the observed gene-gene correlation structure in a given study, and the implementation of PAC to more accurately estimate K. We discuss the strength of our approach in the context of other ensemble-based methods.},

Although some methods do a good job adjusting for batch effects by modifying the data matrices, it is still difficult to remove the batch effects entirely. The remaining batch effect can cause artifacts in the detection of patterns in the data. Results In this study, we consider the batch effect issue in the pattern detection among the samples, such as clustering, dimension reduction, and construction of networks between subjects. Instead of adjusting the original data matrices, we design an adaptive method to directly adjust the dissimilarity matrix between samples. In simulation studies, the method achieved better results recovering true underlying clusters, compared to the leading batch effect adjustment method ComBat. In real data analysis, the method effectively corrected distance matrices, and improved the performance of clustering algorithms.

Here we present a strategy to characterize the immunophenotypes and the antigen-ome of human colorectal cancer.RESULTS:We apply our strategy to a large colorectal cancer cohort (n=598) and show that subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with distinct molecular phenotypes. The characterization of the antigenome shows that a large number of cancer-germline antigens are expressed in all patients. In contrast, neo-antigens are rarely shared between patients, indicating that cancer vaccination requires individualized strategy. Analysis of the genetic basis of the tumors reveals distinct tumor escape mechanisms for the patient subgroups. Hypermutated tumors are depleted of immunosuppressive cells and show upregulation of immunoinhibitory molecules. Non-hypermutated tumors are enriched with immunosuppressive cells, and the expression of immunoinhibitors and MHC molecules is downregulated. Reconstruction of the interaction network of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immunomodulatory molecules followed by a validation with 11 independent cohorts (n=1,945) identifies BCMA as a novel druggable target. Finally, linear regression modeling identifies major determinants of tumor immunogenicity, which include well-characterized modulators as well as a novel candidate, CCR8, which is then tested in an orthologous immunodeficient mouse model.CONCLUSIONS:The immunophenotypes of the tumors and the cancer antigenome remain widely unexplored, and our findings represent a step toward the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional family wise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

abstract = {Systems biology relies on data sets in which the same group of proteins is consistently identified and precisely quantified across multiple samples, a requirement that is only partially achieved by current proteomics approaches. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-also called multiple reaction monitoring-is emerging as a technology that ideally complements the discovery capabilities of shotgun strategies by its unique potential for reliable quantification of analytes of low abundance in complex mixtures. In an SRM experiment, a predefined precursor ion and one of its fragments are selected by the two mass filters of a triple quadrupole instrument and monitored over time for precise quantification. A series of transitions (precursor/fragment ion pairs) in combination with the retention time of the targeted peptide can constitute a definitive assay. Typically, a large number of peptides are quantified during a single LC-MS experiment. This tutorial explains the application of SRM for quantitative proteomics, including the selection of proteotypic peptides and the optimization and validation of transitions. Furthermore, normalization and various factors affecting sensitivity and accuracy are discussed.},

abstract = {It is now known that unwanted noise and unmodeled artifacts such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA microarrays are now capable of providing genome-wide patterns of gene expression across many different conditions. The first level of analysis of these patterns requires determining whether observed differences in expression are significant or not. Current methods are unsatisfactory due to the lack of a systematic framework that can accommodate noise, variability, and low replication often typical of microarray data. RESULTS: We develop a Bayesian probabilistic framework for microarray data analysis. At the simplest level, we model log-expression values by independent normal distributions, parameterized by corresponding means and variances with hierarchical prior distributions. We derive point estimates for both parameters and hyperparameters, and regularized expressions for the variance of each gene by combining the empirical variance with a local background variance associated with neighboring genes. An additional hyperparameter, inversely related to the number of empirical observations, determines the strength of the background variance. Simulations show that these point estimates, combined with a t -test, provide a systematic inference approach that compares favorably with simple t -test or fold methods, and partly compensate for the lack of replication.},

abstract = {Multiple data are available on the self-assembly of mixtures of bilayer-forming amphiphiles, particularly phospholipids and micelle-forming amphiphiles, commonly denoted detergents. The structure of such mixed assemblies has been thoroughly investigated, described in phase diagrams, and theoretically rationalized in terms of the balance between the large spontaneous curvature of the curvophilic detergent and the curvophobic phospholipids. In this critical review, we discuss the mechanism of this process and try to explain the actual mechanism involved in solubilization. Interestingly, membrane solubilization by some detergents is relatively slow and the common attribute of these detergents is that their trans-bilayer movement, commonly denoted flip-flop, is very slow. Only detergents that can flip into the inner monolayer cause relatively rapid solubilization of detergent-saturated bilayers. This occurs via the following sequence of events: 1), relatively rapid penetration of detergent monomers into the outer monolayer; 2), trans-membrane equilibration of detergent monomers between the two monolayers; 3), saturation of the bilayer by detergents and consequent permeabilization of the membrane; and 4), transition of the whole bilayer to thread-like mixed micelles. When the detergent cannot flip to the inner monolayer, the outer monolayer becomes unstable due to mass imbalance between the monolayers and inclusion of the curvophilic detergent molecules in a flat surface. Consequently, the outer monolayer forms mixed micellar structures within the outer monolayer. Shedding of these micelles into the aqueous solution results in partial solubilization. The consequent leakage of detergent into the liposome results in trans-membrane equilibration of detergent and subsequent micellization through the rapid bilayer-saturation mechanism.},

We show here that LTi cells are part of a larger family of proinflammatory ROR$\gamma$t(+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that differentiate from distinct fetal liver ROR$\gamma$t(+) precursors. The fate of ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs is determined by mouse age, and after birth, favors the generation of cells involved in intestinal homeostasis and defense. Contrary to ROR$\gamma$t(+) T cells, however, ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs develop in the absence of microbiota. Our study indicates that ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs evolve to preempt intestinal colonization by microbial symbionts.},

RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model.

abstract = {The avidin-biotin bond is the strongest known biological interaction between a ligand and a protein (Kd = 1.3 x 10-15 M at pH 5.0) (1). The affinity is so high that the avidin-biotin complex is extremely resistant to any type of denaturing agent (2). Biotin (see Fig. 1) is a small, hydrophobic molecule that functions as a coenzyme of carboxylases (3). It is present in all living cells. Avidin is a tetrameric glycoprotein of 66,000-68,000 molecular weight, found in egg albumin and in avian tissues. The interaction between avidin and biotin occurs rapidly, and the stability of the complex has prompted its use for in situ attachment of labels in a broad variety of applications, including immunoassays, DNA hybridization (4-6), and localization of antigens in cells and tissues (7). Avidin has an isoelectric point of 10.5. Because of its positively charged residues and its oligosaccharide component, consisting mostly of mannose and glucosamine (8), avidin can interact nonspecifically with negative charges on cell surfaces and nucleic acids, or with membrane sugar receptors. At times, this causes background problems in histochemical and cytochemical applications. Streptavidin, a near-neutral, biotin-binding protein (9) isolated from the culture medium of Streptomyces avidinii, is a tetrameric nonglycosylated analog of avidin with a molecular weight of about 60,000. Like avidin, each molecule of streptavidin binds four molecules of biotin, with a similar dissociation constant. The two proteins have about 33{\%} sequence homology, and tryptophan residues seem to be involved in their biotin-binding sites (10,11). In general, streptavidin gives less background problems than avidin. This protein, however, contains a tripeptide sequence Arg-Tyr-Asp (RYD) that apparently mimics the binding sequence of fibronectin Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), a universal recognition domain of the extracellular matrix that specifically promotes cell adhesion. Consequently, the streptavidin-cell-surface interaction causes high background in certain applications (12).},

abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray data must be background corrected to remove the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments. RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression is known, eight different background correction alternatives are compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data.

abstract = {"Young" APE-type non-LTR retrotransposons (non-LTRs) typically encode two open reading frames (ORFs 1 and 2). The shorter ORF1 translation product (ORF1p) comprises an RNA binding activity, thought to bind to non-LTR transcript RNA, protect against nuclease degradation and specify nuclear import of the ribonuclear protein complex (RNP). ORF2 encodes a multifunctional protein (ORF2p) comprising apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) and reverse-transcriptase (RT) activities, responsible for genome replication and re-integration into chromosomal DNA. However, some clades of APE-type non-LTRs only encode a single ORF-corresponding to the multifunctional ORF2p outlined above (and for simplicity referred-to as ORF2 below). The absence of an ORF1 correlates with the acquisition of a 2A oligopeptide translational recoding element (some 18-30 amino acids) into the N-terminal region of ORF2p. In the case of non-LTRs encoding two ORFs, the presence of ORF1 would necessarily downregulate the translation of ORF2. We argue that in the absence of an ORF1, 2A could provide the corresponding translational downregulation of ORF2. While multiple molecules of ORF1p are required to decorate the non-LTR transcript RNA in the cytoplasm, conceivably only a single molecule of ORF2p is required for target-primed reverse transcription/integration in the nucleus. Why would the translation of ORF2 need to be controlled by such mechanisms? An "excess" of ORF2p could result in disadvantageous levels of genome instability by, for example, enhancing short, interspersed, element (SINE) retrotransposition and the generation of processed pseudogenes. If so, the acquisition of mechanisms-such as 2A-to control ORF2p biogenesis would be advantageous.},

abstract = {Solid tumors are dependent on preexisting vasculature and neovascularization for their growth. Successful cancer therapies targeting the tumor vasculature would be expected to block the existing tumor blood supply and to prevent tumor neovascularization. We tested the antitumor activity of experimental therapy with 2 distinct antiangiogenic drugs. Vasostatin inhibits endothelial cell growth and neovascularization, and interleukin-12 (IL-12) targets the tumor vasculature acting through interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) and the downstream chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-$\gamma$. Individually, vasostatin and IL-12 produced distinct efficacy profiles in trials aimed at reducing tumor growth in athymic mice. In combination, these inhibitors halted the growth of human Burkitt lymphoma, colon carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Thus, cancer therapy that combines distinct inhibitors of angiogenesis is a novel, effective strategy for the experimental treatment of cancer. },

abstract = {Antibodies empower numerous important scientific, clinical, diagnostic, and industrial applications. Ideally, the epitope(s) targeted by an antibody should be identified and characterized thereby establishing antibody reactivity, highlighting possible cross-reactivities and perhaps even warning against unwanted (e.g. autoimmune) reactivities. Antibodies target proteins either as conformational or linear epitopes. The latter are typically probed with peptides, but the cost of peptide screening programs tends to prohibit comprehensive specificity analysis. To perform high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of linear antibody epitopes, we have used ultrahigh-density peptide microarrays generating several hundred thousand different peptides per array. Using exhaustive length and substitution analysis, we have successfully examined the specificity of a panel of polyclonal antibodies raised against linear epitopes of the human proteome and obtained very detailed descriptions of the involved specificities. The epitopes identified ranged from 4 to 12 amino acids in size. In general, the antibodies were of exquisite specificity frequently disallowing even single conservative substitutions. In several cases, multiple distinct epitopes could be identified for the same target protein thereby suggesting an efficient approach to the generation of paired antibodies. Two alternative epitope mapping approaches identified similar, although not necessarily identical, epitopes. These results show that ultrahigh-density peptide microarrays can be used for linear epitope mapping. With an upper theoretical limit of up to two million individual peptides per array, these peptide microarrays may even be used for a systematic validation of antibodies at the proteomic level.},

Improvements in specificity would improve its cost-effectiveness, as well as reduce anxiety associated with false positive tests. Samples from 235 patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer and matched controls were measured for the presence of AAbs to a panel of six (p53, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, GBU4-5, Annexin I, and SOX2) or seven (p53, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, GBU4-5, SOX2, HuD, and MAGE A4) antigens. Data were assessed in relation to cancer type and stage. The sensitivity and specificity of these two panels were also compared in two prospective consecutive series of 776 and 836 individuals at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. The six-AAb panel gave a sensitivity of 39{\%} with a specificity of 89 {\%}, while the seven-AAb panel gave a sensitivity of 41 {\%} with a specificity of 91 {\%} which, once adjusted for occult cancers in the population, resulted in a specificity of 93 {\%}. Analysis of these AAb assays in the at-risk population confirmed that the seven-AAb panel resulted in a significant increase in the specificity of the test from 82 to 90 {\%}, with no significant change in sensitivity. The change from a six- to a seven-AAb assay can improve the specificity of the test and would result in a PPV of 1 in 8 and an overall accuracy of 92 {\%}.},

Expression vectors encoding 250 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) proteins were generated by PCR/recombination cloning; the proteins were individually expressed with {\textgreater}90{\%} efficiency in Escherichia coli cell-free in vitro transcription and translation reactions, and printed directly without purification onto microarray slides. The protein microarrays were probed with human sera from one of four groups which differed in immune status: sterile immunity or no immunity against experimental challenge following vaccination with radiation-attenuated Pf sporozoites, partial immunity acquired by natural exposure, and no previous exposure to Pf. Overall, 72 highly reactive Pf antigens were identified. Proteomic features associated with immunoreactivity were identified. Importantly, antibody profiles were distinct for each donor group. Information obtained from such analyses will facilitate identifying antigens for vaccine development, dissecting the molecular basis of immunity, monitoring the outcome of whole-organism vaccine trials, and identifying immune correlates of protection.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper considers the problem of testing s null hypotheses simultaneously while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Benjamini and Hochberg (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57(1):289300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications. In particular, the bootstrap method is competitive with methods that require independence if independence holds, but it outperforms these methods under dependence.},

abstract = {These days, it is common practice to base inference about the coefficients in a hetoskedastic linear model on the ordinary least squares estimator in conjunction with using heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors. Even when the true form of heteroskedasticity is unknown, heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors can also used to base valid inference on a weighted least squares estimator and using such an estimator can provide large gains in efficiency over the ordinary least squares estimator. However, intervals based on asymptotic approximations with plug-in standard errors often have coverage that is below the nominal level, especially for small sample sizes. Similarly, tests can have null rejection probabilities that are above the nominal level. It is shown that under unknown hereroskedasticy, a bootstrap approximation to the sampling distribution of the weighted least squares estimator is valid, which allows for inference with improved finite-sample properties. For testing linear constraints, permutations tests are proposed which are exact when the error distribution is symmetric and is asymptotically valid otherwise. Another concern that has discouraged the use of weighting is that the weighted least squares estimator may be less efficient than the ordinary least squares estimator when the model used to estimate the unknown form of the heteroskedasticity is misspecified. To address this problem, a new estimator is proposed that is asymptotically at least as efficient as both the ordinary and the weighted least squares estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate the attractive finite-sample properties of this new estimator as well as the improvements in performance realized by bootstrap confidence intervals.},

abstract = {Introduction: The reduction in lung cancer mortality associated with computed tomography (CT) screening has led to its increased use and a concomitant increase in the detection of benign pulmonary nodules. Many individuals found to have benign nodules undergo unnecessary, costly, and invasive procedures. Therefore, there is a need for companion diagnostics that stratify individuals with pul-monary nodules into high-risk or low-risk groups. Lung cancers can trigger host immune responses and elicit anti-bodies against tumor antigens. The identification of these autoantibodies (AAbs) and their corresponding antigens may expand our knowledge of cancer immunity, leading to early diagnosis or even benefiting immunotherapy. Previous studies were performed mostly in the context of comparing cancers and healthy (smoker) controls. We have performed one of the first studies to understand humoral immune response in patients with cancer, patients with benign nodules, and healthy smokers. Methods: We first profiled seroreactivity to 10,000 full-length human proteins in 40 patients with early-stage lung cancer and 40 smoker controls by using nucleic acid programmable protein arrays to identify candidate cancer-specific AAbs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of promising candidates were performed on 137 patients with lung cancer and 127 smoker controls, as well as on 170 subjects with benign pulmonary nodules. Results: From protein microarray screening experiments using a discovery set of 40 patients and 40 smoker controls, 17 antigens showing higher reactivity in lung cancer cases relative to the controls were subsequently selected for evaluation in a large sample set (n ¼ 264) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A five-AAb classifier (tetratricopeptide repeat domain 14 [TTC14], B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase [BRAF], actin like 6B [ACTL6B], MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2 [MORC2], and cancer/testis antigen 1B [CTAG1B]) that can differen-tiate lung cancers from smoker controls with a sensitivity of 30{\%} at 89{\%} specificity was developed. We further tested AAb responses in subjects with CT-positive benign nodules (n ¼ 170), and developed a five-AAb panel (keratin 8, type II, TTC14, Kruppel-like factor 8, BRAF, and tousled like ki-nase 1) with a sensitivity of 30{\%} at 88{\%} specificity. Inter-estingly, messenger RNA levels of six AAb targets (TTC14, BRAF, MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2, cancer/testis antigen 1B, keratin 8, type II, and tousled like kinase 1) were also found to increase in lung adenocarcinoma tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data set.these antibodies warrant future validation using a larger sample set and/or longitudinal samples individually or as a panel. They could potentially be part of companion molec-ular diagnostic modalities that will benefit subjects under-going CT screening for lung cancer.},

The study design is based on a dilution series of two human tissues (blood and placenta), tested in duplicate on each platform. The results of a comparison between the platforms indicate very high agreement, particularly for genes which are predicted to be differentially expressed between the two tissues. Agreement was strongly correlated with the level of expression of a gene. Concordance was also improved when probes on the two platforms could be identified as being likely to target the same set of transcripts of a given gene. These results shed light on the causes or failures of agreement across microarray platforms. The set of probes we found to be most highly reproducible can be used by others to help increase confidence in analyses of other data sets using these platforms.},

The presentation of the theoretical treatment is based on a demonstration of the equivalence of the force acting on an ion in a quadrupole Ðeld and the force derived from the Mathieu equation; this equivalence permits the application of the solutions of Mathieu{\"{I}}s equation to the conÐnement of gaseous ions. Resonant excitation, collision-induced dissociation, mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry and chemical ionization are discussed in the context of analytical applications. Sample calculations of the trapping parameters and the axial secular frequency, qz bz , mass range, mass range extension and the magnitude of the potential well depth are given.},

abstract = {Protein microarrays are similar to DNA microarrays; both enabling the parallel interrogation of thousands of probes immobilized on a surface. Consequently, they have benefited from technologies previously developed for DNA microarrays. However, assumptions for the analysis of DNA microarrays do not always translate to protein arrays, especially in the case of normalization. Hence, we have developed an experimental and computational framework to assess normalization procedures for protein microarrays. Specifically, we profiled two sera with markedly different autoantibody compositions. To analyze intra- and interarray variability, we compared a set of control proteins across subarrays and the corresponding spots across multiple arrays, respectively. To estimate the degree to which the normalization could help reveal true biological separability, we tested the difference in the signal between the sera relative to the variability within replicates. Next, by mixing the sera in different proportions (titrations), we correlated the reactivity of proteins with serum concentration. Finally, we analyzed the effect of normalization procedures on the list of reactive proteins. We compared global and quantile normalization, techniques that have traditionally been employed for DNA microarrays, with a novel normalization approach based on a robust linear model (RLM) making explicit use of control proteins. We show that RLM normalization is able to reduce both intra- and interarray technical variability while maintaining biological differences. Moreover, in titration experiments, RLM normalization enhances the correlation of protein signals with serum concentration. Conversely, while quantile and global normalization can reduce interarray technical variability, neither is as effective as RLM normalization in maintaining biological differences. Most importantly, both introduce artifacts that distort the signals and affect the correct identification of reactive proteins, impairing their use for biomarker discovery. Hence, we show RLM normalization is better suited to protein arrays than approaches used for DNA microarrays.},

Phase and velocity of the acoustic wave are influenced by the specific adsorption of antibody molecules onto the antigen-coated sensor surface.

Kinetic experiments revealed no cell necrosis after 24h of treatment with TiO(2) (0-100 microg/ml). In contrast, TiO(2)-induced change in cellular morphology in a concentration-dependent manner in neutrophils over time, indicating its potential to activate these cells. To further support this, we demonstrated that TiO(2) markedly and rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of two key enzymes, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (Erk-1/2). We also determined the effects of TiO(2) on two neutrophil functions requiring a longer exposure period between NPs and cells: apoptosis and cytokine production. Interestingly, at concentrations {\textgreater}or=20 microg/ml, TiO(2) inhibited neutrophil apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner after 24h of treatment. Supernatants from TiO(2)-induced neutrophils were harvested after 24h and tested for the presence of 36 different analytes (cytokines, chemokines) using an antibody array assay. TiO(2) treatment increased production of 13 (36{\%}) analytes, including IL-8, which exhibited the greatest increase ( approximately 16 x control cell levels). The increased production of IL-8 was confirmed by ELISA. We conclude that TiO(2) exerts important neutrophil agonistic properties in vitro.},

abstract = {Background: Anisakiasis is a global disease caused by the consumption of raw or lightly cooked fish parasitized with third-stage Anisakis larvae. Anisakis simplex allergens may cause severe allergic reactions including angio-oedema, urticaria and anaphylaxis. Approximately 80{\%} of allergic patients have allergen-specific IgE against Ani s 1, and the diagnostic value of testing for antibodies to Ani s 1 has been extensively demonstrated. However, no previous studies have investigated the molecular aspects of the allergic response to Ani s 1. Knowledge of allergen-specific T cell and B cell (IgE and IgG4) epitopes is important for elucidating the immunological mechanisms underlying allergic responses, and for understanding why particular proteins behave as allergens. Objective: To elucidate the main T cell- and B cell (IgE and IgG4)- binding regions of Ani s 1. Methods: T cell epitopes were identified by peptide proliferation assays using T cell lines derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 11 patients with Anisakis allergy, and IgE and IgG4 epitopes were identified by microarray immunoassay using sera from a different group of 11 patients with Anisakis allergy. Results: Several T cell epitopes of Ani s 1 were identified, of which Ani s 1 (145–156), Ani s 1 (151–162) and Ani s 1 (163–171) located at the C-terminal end of the protein were the most relevant. IgE and IgG4 recognized largely the same peptides, including Ani s 1 (22–41), Ani s 1 (25–44), Ani s 1 (27–47), Ani s 1 (37–56) and Ani s 1 (94–113). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: This is the first report describing the T cell epitopes of an important allergen of A. simplex, and the first B cell epitope study of this allergen in the Spanish population. This information can help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the allergic response to Ani s 1, potentially leading to therapeutic and diagnostic advances.},

Detecting pathologies at their earliest stages can significantly affect patient discomfort, prognosis, therapeutic intervention, survival rates, and recurrence. Diagnosis and monitoring often require painful invasive procedures such as biopsies and repeated blood draws, adding undue stress to an already unpleasant experience. The discovery of saliva-based microbial, immunologic, and molecular biomarkers offers unique opportunities to bypass these measures by utilizing oral fluids to evaluate the condition of both healthy and diseased individuals. Here we discuss saliva and its significance as a source of indicators for local, systemic, and infectious disorders. We highlight contemporary innovations and explore recent discoveries that deem saliva a mediator of the body's physiological condition. Additionally, we examine the current state of salivary diagnostics and its associated technologies, future aspirations, and potential as the preferred route of disease detection, monitoring, and prognosis.},

abstract = {It has been reported that repetitive freeze-thaw cycles of aqueous suspensions of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine form vesicles with a diameter smaller than 200 nm. We have applied the same treatment to a series of phospholipid suspensions with particular emphasis on dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPC/DOPA) mixtures. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed that these unsaturated lipids form unilamellar vesicles after 10 cycles of freeze-thawing. Both electron microscopy and broad-band 31P NMR spectra indicated a disparity of the vesicle sizes with a highest frequency for small unilamellar vesicles (diameters {\textless} or =30 nm) and a population of larger vesicles with a frequency decreasing exponentially as the diameter increases. From 31P NMR investigations we inferred that the average diameter of DOPC/DOPA vesicles calculated on the basis of an exponential size distribution was of the order of 100 nm after 10 freeze-thaw cycles and only 60 nm after 50 cycles. Fragmentation by repeated freeze-thawing does not have the same efficiency for all lipid mixtures. As found already by others, fragmentation into small vesicles requires the presence of salt and does not take place in pure water. Repetitive freeze-thawing is also efficient to fragment large unilamellar vesicles obtained by filtration. If applied to sonicated DOPC vesicles, freeze-thawing treatment causes fusion of sonicated unilamellar vesicles into larger vesicles only in pure water. These experiments show the usefulness of NMR as a complementary technique to electron microscopy for size determination of lipid vesicles. The applicability of the freeze-thaw technique to different lipid mixtures confirms that this procedure is a simple way to obtain unilamellar vesicles.},

abstract = {Background: Patients on warfarin therapy undergo invasive and expensive checks for the coagulability of their blood. No information on coagulation levels is currently available between two controls. Methodology: A method was developed to determine warfarin in oral fluid by HPLC and fluorimetric detection. The chromatographic separation was performed at room temperature on a C-18 reversed-phase column, 65{\%} PBS and 35{\%} methanol mobile phase, flow rate 0.7 mL/min, injection volume 25 $\mu$L, excitation wavelength 310 nm, emission wavelength 400 nm. Findings: The method was free from interference and matrix effect, linear in the range 0.2-100 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL. Its coefficient of variation was {\textless}3{\%} for intra-day measurements and {\textless}5{\%} for inter-day measurements. The average concentration of warfarin in the oral fluid of 50 patients was 2.5±1.6 ng/mL (range 0.8-7.6 ng/mL). Dosage was not correlated to INR (r = -0.03, p = 0.85) but positively correlated to warfarin concentration in the oral fluid (r = 0.39, p = 0.006). The correlation between warfarin concentration and pH in the oral fluid (r = 0.37, p = 0.009) confirmed the importance of pH in regulating the drug transfer from blood. A correlation between warfarin concentration in the oral fluid and INR was only found in samples with pH values ≥7.2 (r = 0.84, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Warfarin diffuses from blood to oral fluid. The method allows to measure its concentration in this matrix and to analyze correlations with INR and other parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Ghimenti et al.},

However, most of these techniques focus on continuous epitopes, whereas fast and reliable identification and verification of discontinuous epitopes remains barely amenable. In this paper, we describe a computational workflow for the detection of discontinuous epitopes on proteins. The workflow uses a given protein 3D structure as input, and combines a per residue solvent accessibility constraint with epitope to paratope shape complementarity measures and binding energies for assigning antigenic determinants in the conformational context. We have developed the procedure on a given set of 26 antigen-antibody complexes with a known structure, and have further expanded the available paratope shapes by generating a virtual paratope library in order to improve the screening for candidate residues constituting discontinuous epitopes. Applying the workflow on the 26 given antigens with known discontinuous epitopes resulted in the correct identification of the spatial proximity of 12 antigen-antibody interaction sites. Combining solvent accessibility, shape complementarity and binding energies towards the identification of discontinuous epitopes clearly outperforms approaches solely considering accessibility and residue distance constraints.},

abstract = {Regulation of heterologous gene expression is of prime importance for a wide variety of basic and applied biological research areas including functional genomics, tissue engineering, gene therapy, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Initial gene regulation strategies employed endogenous responsive elements, which resulted in pleiotropic interference of transgene expression with host regulatory networks. Current regulation systems are binary and consist of chimeric transactivators and responsive target promoters of heterologous bacterial or insect origin, or they contain artificially designed components. Regulation of generic systems is based on binding of a transactivator to its cognate promoter, which is modulated by specific molecules such as antibiotics or hormones and brings the transactivation domain into contact with a minimal promoter, thereby inducing target gene expression. Binary gene regulation concepts have been significantly refined in recent years with a focus to improve their regulation performance and their compatibility with human-therapeutic use. In this review we present a detailed analysis of currently available mammalian gene regulation systems and document progress that has pioneered the use of such systems in various aspects of human therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Freeze-thaw cycling is an important processing step in the preparation of liposomes that leads to the encapsulation of drug molecules. There is considerable variability in the number of freeze-thaw cycles reported in the literature. This work is designed to aid in liposomal formulation design by gaining an insight into the drug encapsulation process and an understanding of liposome stabilization during various thawing conditions.

METHODS: The effects of different thawing temperatures, as well as "annealing" at subzero temperatures on a liposome formulation, are reported here.

RESULTS: Two freeze-anneal-thaw (FANNT) cycles (freezing to -196°C, annealing at -1.4°C for {\~{}}30 min, thawing at 65°C) resulted in the maximum predicted encapsulation efficiency without causing any significant change in particle size or zeta potential. Annealing at -22°C was shown to be destabilizing due to limited hydration of the liposomes in the frozen state.

CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that two important processes are occurring during the FANNT cycling that affect liposome encapsulation efficiency. The first is drug diffusion in the frozen state and the second is fusion/destabilization of the liposomes. This is the first report on the annealing of liposomes and understanding the mechanism of drug encapsulation using the freeze-thaw cycling method.},

abstract = {A kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and optimized for detection of antibodies to Neospora sp. in cattle. Sonicated tachyzoites of Neospora sp. isolated from an aborted bovine fetus were used as antigen. Variability in immunoblot patterns among positive sera, and the fact that all life stages of the parasites are unknown, justified use of a multiple-antigen ELISA to allow for maximum sensitivity. Immunoblot analysis revealed negligible cross-reactions between Toxoplasma gondii antigen and Neospora sp. antisera and between Neospora sp. antigen and antisera from various apicomplexan parasites. The maximum positive-to-negative Vmax (average maximum slope of the optical density over time) ratio was obtained using 200 ng/well of sonicated tachyzoite antigen and a 1:200 serum dilution. Using logistic regression to determine the optimal cutoff point between known infected and noninfected cattle, a sample-to-positive control Vmax ratio of 0.45 was found to maximize the percent correct classification, with an estimated sensitivity of 88.6{\%} and specificity of 96.5{\%}. Use of Neospora caninum antigen following the same protocol demonstrated no difference in ELISA interpretation. Comparison with an existing indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test showed the ELISA to be the more sensitive and specific test for serodiagnosis of Neospora infection in cattle.},

A myc-peptide micro-array immunoassay showed an antibody limit-of-detection (LOD) superior to a microtiter plate-based ELISA.

Saliva was collected from 63 patients with measles, 19 with mumps, and 150 with rubella, which were all clinically diagnosed and serologically confirmed. Virus specific IgM was detected in 92{\%} of measles, 75{\%} of mumps, and 100{\%} of rubella saliva samples collected during the first week of illness. Between 1 and 5 weeks after onset virus specific IgM was detected in 100{\%} of saliva specimens. After the 5th week the proportion of reactive specimens declined. The specificity of the MACRIA tests was established by testing saliva samples collected from blood donors for measles (88), mumps (88), and rubella IgM (91). All of the saliva specimens tested for measles and rubella specific IgM were unreactive, 1/88 specimens tested for mumps specific IgM contained significant reactivity. Saliva specimens collected from acute cases of MMR were tested in all 3 MACRIAs. A small proportion of saliva samples contained detectable IgM of more than one virus infection. Rubella and measles specific IgG was detected in the saliva of all cases from the 4th or 5th day of illness, respectively. Detection of mumps specific IgG was less successful. We have demonstrated that virus specific IgM can be reliably detected in saliva samples collected from acute cases of measles, mumps, and rubella and identified 1-5 weeks after onset of illness as the optimum time for collection of samples.},

abstract = {The effects of mutation of key conserved active-site residues (Tyr-73, Phe-418, Trp-430, Arg-516, Asn-518, His-520 and His-563) of glucose oxidase from Penicillium amagasakiense on substrate binding were investigated. Kinetic studies on the oxidation of beta-D-glucose combined with molecular modelling showed the side chain of Arg-516, which forms two hydrogen bonds with the 3-OH group of beta-D-glucose, to be absolutely essential for the efficient binding of beta-D-glucose. The R516K variant, whose side chain forms only one hydrogen bond with the 3-OH group of beta-D-glucose, exhibits an 80-fold higher apparent K(m) (513 mM) but a V(max) only 70{\%} lower (280 units/mg) than the wild type. The complete elimination of a hydrogen-bond interaction between residue 516 and the 3-OH group of beta-D-glucose through the substitution R516Q effected a 120-fold increase in the apparent K(m) for glucose (to 733 mM) and a decrease in the V(max) to 1/30 (33 units/mg). None of the other substitutions, with the exception of variant F418A, affected the apparent K(m) more than 6-fold. In contrast, the removal of aromatic or bulky residues at positions 73, 418 or 430 resulted in decreases in the maximum rates of glucose oxidation to less than 1/90. Variants of the potentially catalytically active His-520 and His-563 were completely, or almost completely, inactive. Thus, of the residues forming the active site of glucose oxidase, Arg-516 is the most critical amino acid for the efficient binding of beta-D-glucose by the enzyme, whereas aromatic residues at positions 73, 418 and 430 are important for the correct orientation and maximal velocity of glucose oxidation.

A modified hepatitis C antibody assay for saliva was developed and linked to testing carried out in the diagnostic laboratory. Correlation between the presence of antibody in serum and in saliva was poor (100{\%} vs 85{\%}). However, of 98 patients who were saliva antibody positive, 96 (98{\%}) were also serum hepatitis C RNA positive and two (2{\%}) were serum hepatitis C RNA negative. Hence, the correlation between a positive salivary antibody test and the serum hepatitis C RNA status of intravenous drug users suggests that this test could be used as a surrogate marker for hepatitis C viraemia in epidemiological studies.},

Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides.

abstract = {Phagocytosis is a principal component of the body's innate immunity in which macrophages internalize targets in an actin-dependent manner. Targets vary widely in shape and size and include particles such as pathogens and senescent cells. Despite considerable progress in understanding this complicated process, the role of target geometry in phagocytosis has remained elusive. Previous studies on phagocytosis have been performed using spherical targets, thereby overlooking the role of particle shape. Using polystyrene particles of various sizes and shapes, we studied phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. We report a surprising finding that particle shape, not size, plays a dominant role in phagocytosis. All shapes were capable of initiating phagocytosis in at least one orientation. However, the local particle shape, measured by tangent angles, at the point of initial contact dictates whether macrophages initiate phagocytosis or simply spread on particles. The local shape determines the complexity of the actin structure that must be created to initiate phagocytosis and allow the membrane to move over the particle. Failure to create the required actin structure results in simple spreading and not internalization. Particle size primarily impacts the completion of phagocytosis in cases where particle volume exceeds the cell volume.},

abstract = {Immunotherapy of cancer is attractive because of its potential for specificity and limited side effects. The efficacy of this approach may be improved by providing adjuvant signals and an inflammatory environment for immune cell activation. We evaluated antitumor immune responses in mice after treatment of OVA-expressing B16-F0 tumors with single (15 Gy) or fractionated (5 × 3 Gy) doses of localized ionizing radiation. Irradiated mice had cells with greater capability to present tumor Ags and specific T cells that secreted IFN-$\gamma$ upon peptide stimulation within tumor-draining lymph nodes than nonirradiated mice. Immune activation in tumor-draining lymph nodes correlated with an increase in the number of CD45+ cells infiltrating single dose irradiated tumors compared with nonirradiated mice. Similarly, irradiated mice had increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that secreted IFN-$\gamma$ and lysed tumor cell targets. Peptide-specific IFN-$\gamma$ responses were directed against both the class I and class II MHC-restricted OVA peptides OVA257–264 and OVA323–339, respectively, as well as the endogenous class I MHC-restricted B16 tumor peptide tyrosinase-related protein 2180–188. Adoptive transfer studies indicated that the increased numbers of tumor Ag-specific immune cells within irradiated tumors were most likely due to enhanced trafficking of these cells to the tumor site. Together these results suggest that localized radiation can increase both the generation of antitumor immune effector cells and their trafficking to the tumor site. },

Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip (e.g. known pathways, specific areas of the genome or clusters from a cluster analysis). RESULT: The test allows groups of genes of different size to be compared, because the test gives one p-value for the group, not a p-value for each gene. Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene ontology databases for interesting pathways. Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are tested. Special attention is given to visualizations of the test result, focussing on the associations between samples and showing the impact of individual genes on the test result.

Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins, peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer. Arrays were incubated with patient serum, and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array. We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera, and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA and post-translationally modified antigens. Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses, and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases.},

These security checks, in response to the post 9/11 and 2009 “Underwear Bomber” terrorist threats, have become increasingly burdensome to the general public due to the wide spread deployment of “enhanced screening systems.” The enhanced screening systems that have generated the most controversy are the passenger “full-body scanners.” These systems enable airport security personnel to effectively detect contraband (often concealed under clothing) without the physical contact necessitated by a strip search. The two types of full-body scanners (also known as Advanced Imaging Technology systems), used in airports in the United States and around the world are referred to as backscatter technology units and millimeter-wave technology units. Although their respective radiation emissions vary, both scanners serve the same purpose; that is, the detection of concealed metallic and non-metallic threats in the form of liquids, gels, plastics, etc. Although enhanced screening systems were deployed to further public safety efforts, they have also generated wide spread public concern. Specifically, these concerns address the potential of adverse health and privacy issues that may result from continued public exposure to full-body scanner systems.},

The package offers flexibility in the choice of the dependence measure which can be user-defined. The components are found sequentially. A first component is obtained and a smooth fit produces residuals. Then, a second component orthogonal to the first is found which is most dependent on the residuals, and so on. The package can handle models with more than one response. A panoply of models can be achieved through package groc: robust multiple or multivariate linear regression, nonparametric regression on orthogonal components, and classical or robust partial least squares models. Functions for predictions and cross-validation are available and helpful in model selection. The merit of a fit through cross-validation can be assessed with the predicted residual error sum of squares or the predicted residual error median absolute deviation which is more appropriate in the presence of outliers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play an important role in cancer development by post-transcriptionally affecting the expression of critical genes. The aims of this study were two-fold: (i) to develop a robust method to isolate miRNAs from small volumes of saliva and (ii) to develop a panel of saliva-based diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Five differentially expressed miRNAs were selected from miScript™ miRNA microarray data generated using saliva from five HNSCC patients and five healthy controls. Their differential expression was subsequently confirmed by RT-qPCR using saliva samples from healthy controls (n = 56) and HNSCC patients (n = 56). These samples were divided into two different cohorts, i.e., a first confirmatory cohort (n = 21) and a second independent validation cohort (n = 35), to narrow down the miRNA diagnostic panel to three miRNAs: miR-9, miR-134 and miR-191. This diagnostic panel was independently validated using HNSCC miRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), encompassing 334 tumours and 39 adjacent normal tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic capacity of the panel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: On average 60 ng/$\mu$L miRNA was isolated from 200 $\mu$L of saliva. Overall a good correlation was observed between the microarray data and the RT-qPCR data. We found that miR-9 (P {\textless}0.0001), miR-134 (P {\textless}0.0001) and miR-191 (P {\textless}0.001) were differentially expressed between saliva from HNSCC patients and healthy controls, and that these miRNAs provided a good discriminative capacity with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.85 (P {\textless}0.0001), 0.74 (P {\textless} 0.001) and 0.98 (P {\textless} 0.0001), respectively. In addition, we found that the salivary miRNA data showed a good correlation with the TCGA miRNA data, thereby providing an independent validation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We show that we have developed a reliable method to isolate miRNAs from small volumes of saliva, and that the saliva-derived miRNAs miR-9, miR-134 and miR-191 may serve as novel biomarkers to reliably detect HNSCC.},

Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms.

The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.

In this study, we sought to determine the effect of the size and dispersion of one type of these NPs (zinc oxide) on immune cell function and cytotoxicity for human macrophages and monocytes, which are key cells for particle and debris clearance in the skin. We have found that particle size and coating, but surprisingly, not agglomeration, are key determinates of nanoparticle cytotoxicity in an in vitro culture system of human immune cells. Most importantly, we found that this nanoparticle-induced cellular immune signalling, can be decoupled from cytotoxicity and surface coating, so that at an equivalent cytotoxic load, smaller particles induce a greater cellular response.},

abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by "batch effects," the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

abstract = {Normal sera contain a large number of naturally occurring autoantibodies which can mask important disease-associated ones. Western blotting has evolved as the most important tool to demonstrate autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases, because of its ability to simultaneous screening for a wide spectrum of different antigens. In previous studies we have shown the diagnostic potential of the analysis of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases by means of multivariate statistics and artificial neural networks. However, the Western blotting procedure remains very time-consuming and is also limited in sensitivity. Therefore, we used an on-chip approach for the analysis of autoantibodies. This ProteinChip system uses ProteinChip arrays and SELDI-TOF MS (surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) technology for capturing, detection, and analysis of proteins without labelling or without the need of chemical modification. The microscale design of the arrays allows the analysis of very small quantities of proteins. In the present study, we used arrays with biologically activated surfaces that permit antibody capture studies. Protein-A-Chips were incubated with sera of patients (n = 12). After washing, the chips were incubated with a complex solution of autoantigens and subsequently washed again. If the Protein-A bound autoantibodies recognized their antigens, these proteins could be separated by their molecular masses and were to be detected by mass spectrometry. Previous studies using monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that the detection limit is in the attomole level. Furthermore, all sera were analyzed by conventional Western blotting for direct comparison. In the present study, we have shown complex on-chip antibody-antigen reactions. At higher molecular weights ({\textgreater} 30 kDa) the detection sensitivity of this on-chip method was comparable to conventional Western blotting. At lower molecular mass, the Western blot technique is easily exceeded by the on-chip method. Considering that this on-chip procedure is quite easy to use, is much less time-consuming than Western blotting, and is much more sensitive at least in the low molecular weight range, the SELDI-TOF technology is a very promising approach for the screening of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases. Due to its versatility, this on-chip technology could allow the large-scale screening for complex autoantibody distributions for diagnostic purposes and early detection of autoimmune diseases might be possible.},

abstract = {The purpose of this mini-review is to make an update about the present and future applications of saliva as a diagnostic bio-fluid in many fields of science such as dentistry, medicine and pharmacotherapy. Using saliva as a fluid for diagnostic pur-poses would be a huge breakthrough for both patients and healthcare providers since saliva collection is easy, non-inva-sive and inexpensive. We will go through the current main diagnostic applications of saliva, and provide a highlight on the emerging, newly developing technologies and tools for cancer screening, detection and monitoring. Abstract In this review, we provide an update on the current and future applications of saliva for diag-nostic purposes. There are many advantages of using saliva as a biofluid. Its collection is fast, easy, inexpensive, and non-invasive. In addition, saliva, as a ''mirror of the body,'' can reflect the physiological and pathological state of the body. Therefore, it serves as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in many fields of science such as medicine, dentistry, and pharmacotherapy. Introduced in 2008, the term ''Salivaomics'' aimed to highlight the rapid development of knowledge about various ''omics'' constituents of saliva, including: proteome, transcriptome, micro-RNA, metabolome, and microbiome. In the last few years, researchers have developed new technologies and validated a wide range of salivary biomarkers that will soon make the use of saliva a clinical reality. However, a great need still exists for convenient and accurate point-of-care devices that can serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. In addition, there is an urgent need to decipher the scientific rationale and mechanisms that convey systemic diseases to saliva. Another promising tech-nology called liquid biopsy enables detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and fragments of tumor DNA in saliva, thus enabling non-invasive early detection of various cancers. The newly developed technology—electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) provides near perfect detection of actionable mutations in lung cancer patients. These recent advances widened the salivary diagnostic approach from the oral cavity to the whole physiological system, and thus point towards a promising future of salivary diagnostics for personalized individual medicine applications including clinical decisions and post-treatment outcome predictions.},

abstract = {Interference with inhibitory immunological checkpoints controlling T cell activation provides new opportunities to augment cancer immunotherapies. Whereas cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen-4 blockade has shown promising preclinical and clinical results, therapeutic CD4+CD25+ T reg cell depletion has failed to consistently enhance immune-based therapies. Using B16/BL6, a transplantable murine melanoma model, we show a dichotomy between the effects of T reg cell depletion on tumor rejection dependent on whether depletion occurs before (prophylactic) or after (therapeutic) tumor engraftment. Failure to promote rejection with therapeutic depletion is not related to lack of T reg cell depletion, to elimination of CD25+ effector T cells, or to a failure to enhance systemic antitumor T cell responses, but correlates with failure of effector cells to infiltrate the tumor and increase the intratumor ratio of effector T cell/T reg cell. Finally, systemic antitumor responses generated upon therapeutic T reg cell depletion are significantly stronger than those generated in the presence of T reg cells, and are capable of eliciting rejection of established tumors after transfer into immunoablated recipients receiving combination immunotherapy. The data demonstrate a dissociation between measurable systemic responses and tumor rejection during CD25-directed T reg cell depletion, and suggest an alternative, clinically applicable strategy for the treatment of established tumors. },

The C-C chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent monocyte activator in vitro and has been associated with monocytic infiltration in several inflammatory diseases. One C-C chemokine receptor, CCR2, has been identified that mediates in vitro responses to MCP-1 and its close structural homologues. CCR2 has also recently been demonstrated to be a fusion cofactor for several HIV isolates. To investigate the normal physiological function of CCR2, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the ccr2 gene. Mice deficient for CCR2 developed normally and had no hematopoietic abnormalities. However, ccr2(-/-) mice failed to recruit macrophages in an experimental peritoneal inflammation model. In addition, these mice were unable to clear infection by the intracellular bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes. These results suggest that CCR2 has a nonredundant role as a major mediator of macrophage recruitment and host defense against bacterial pathogens and that MCP-1 and other CCR2 ligands are effectors of those functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The simplicity and potential of minimal invasive testing using serum from patients make auto-antibody based biomarkers a very promising tool for use in diagnostics of cancer and auto-immune disease. Although several methods exist for elucidating candidate-protein markers, immobilizing these onto membranes and generating so called macroarrays is of limited use for marker validation. Especially when several hundred samples have to be analysed, microarrays could serve as a good alternative since processing macro membranes is cumbersome and reproducibility of results is moderate.

METHODS: Candidate markers identified by SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) screenings of brain and lung tumour were used for macroarray and microarray production. For microarray production recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli by autoinduction and purified His-tag (histidine-tagged) proteins were then used for the production of protein microarrays. Protein arrays were hybridized with the serum samples from brain and lung tumour patients.

RESULT: Methods for the generation of microarrays were successfully established when using antigens derived from membrane-based selection. Signal patterns obtained by microarrays analysis of brain and lung tumour patients' sera were highly reproducible (R = 0.92-0.96). This provides the technical foundation for diagnostic applications on the basis of auto-antibody patterns. In this limited test set, the assay provided high reproducibility and a broad dynamic range to classify all brain and lung samples correctly.

CONCLUSION: Protein microarray is an efficient means for auto-antibody-based detection when using SEREX-derived clones expressing antigenic proteins. Protein microarrays are preferred to macroarrays due to the easier handling and the high reproducibility of auto-antibody testing. Especially when using only a few microliters of patient samples protein microarrays are ideally suited for validation of auto-antibody signatures for diagnostic purposes.},

A fundamental statistical issue in clustering is which clusters are “really there,” as opposed to being artifacts of the natural sampling variation. We propose SigClust as a simple and natural approach to this fundamental statistical problem. In particular, we define a cluster as data coming from a single Gaussian distribution and formulate the problem of assessing statistical significance of clustering as a testing procedure. This Gaussian null assumption allows direct formulation of p values that effectively quantify the significance of a given clustering. HDLSS covariance estimation for SigClust is achieved by a combination of invariance principles, together with a factor analysis model. The properties of SigClust are studied. Simulated examples, as well as an application to a real cancer microarray data set, show that the proposed method...},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Li and Chen (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 80 (1985) 759) proposed a method for principal components using projection-pursuit techniques. In classical principal components one searches for directions with maximal variance, and their approach consists of replacing this variance by a robust scale measure. Li and Chen showed that this estimator is consistent, qualitative robust and inherits the breakdown point of the robust scale estimator. We complete their study by deriving the influence function of the estimators for the eigenvectors, eigenvalues and the associated dispersion matrix. Corresponding Gaussian efficiencies are presented as well. Asymptotic normality of the estimators has been treated in a paper of Cui et al. (Biometrika 90 (2003) 953), complementing the results of this paper. Furthermore, a simple explicit version of the projection-pursuit based estimator is proposed and shown to be fast to compute, orthogonally equivariant, and having the maximal finite-sample breakdown point property. We will illustrate the method with a real data example. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Autoantibodies against autologous tumor-associated antigens have been detected in the asymptomatic stage of cancer and can thus serve as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. Moreover, because autoantibodies are found in sera, they can be screened easily using a noninvasive approach. Consequently, many studies have been initiated to identify novel autoantibodies relevant to various cancer types. To facilitate autoantibody discovery, approaches that allow the simultaneous identification of multiple autoantibodies are preferred. Five such techniques--SEREX, phage display, protein microarray, SERPA and MAPPing--are discussed here. In the second part of this review, we discussed autoantibodies found in the five most common cancers (lung, breast, colorectal, stomach and liver). The discovery of panels of tumor-associated antigens and autoantibody signatures with high sensitivity and specificity would aid in the development of diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics for cancer patients.},

abstract = {Multiple hypothesis testing is concerned with controlling the rate of false positives when testing several hypotheses simultaneously. One multiple hypothesis testing error measure is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be the expected proportion of false positives among all significant hypotheses. The FDR is especially appropriate for exploratory analyses in which one is interested in finding several significant results among many tests. In this work, we introduce a modified version of the FDR called the "positive false discovery rate" (pFDR). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the pFDR and investigate its statistical properties. When assuming the test statistics follow a mixture distribution, we show that the pFDR can be written as a Bayesian posterior probability and can be connected to classification theory. These properties remain asymptotically true under fairly general conditions, even under certain forms of dependence. Also, a new quantity called the "q-value" is introduced and investigated, which is a natural "Bayesian posterior p-value," or rather the pFDR analogue of the p-value.},

@article{Yuzhalin2012,
abstract = {The last decade has seen the emergence of immunomodulators as therapeutic agents in cancer treatment. Interleukins (ILs) are a category of small cell-signaling molecules that organize communication and interaction between immune cells and therefore they could be used as perfect immunomodulators. IL-12 is a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy since it plays a major role in development of antitumor immune response. Numerous studies report that IL-12 promotes an effective destruction of cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IL-12 has anti-angiogenic activity and it is able to dramatically decrease tumor-supportive activities of tumor-associated macrophages. The first part of the review is devoted to immunobiology of IL-12. Signaling pathways of IL-12 as well as clinical trials of this cytokine are discussed. The second part of the review is concerned on the inherited variations in IL-12A and IL-12B genes that could modulate cancer susceptibility, and as a consequence, possess predictive, therapeutic, or prognostic significance. It is known that functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-12A and IL-12B genes may dramatically affect on protein expression level, or alter its functions, which may lead to immune disorders, autoimmune diseases, and eventually contribute to cancer occurrence. The list of genetic polymorphisms for further investigations might include the following: IL-12B{\_}+1188A/C (rs3212227), IL-12A{\_}+277G/A (rs568408), IL-12A{\_}-798T/A (rs582054), IL-12A{\_}-504T/G (rs190533), IL-12A{\_}-1148T/C (rs2243123), and IL-12B{\_}+16974 A/C. Perhaps, some of these SNPs may become an attractive target for oncogenomics and possibly could be used in programs of early cancer diagnosis as well as cancer prevention in the nearest future.},

abstract = {The presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions in the urinary bladder is associated with a high risk of disease progression to a muscle invasive stage. In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urathelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS. Identification of this expression signature could provide guidance for the selection of therapy and follow-up regimen in patients with early stage bladder cancer.},

This article discusses dif- ferent criteria for error control in resampling-based multiple testing, including (a) the family wise error rate of Westfall {\&} Young (1993) and (b) the false discovery rate developed by Benjamini {\&} Hochberg (1995), both from a frequentist viewpoint; and (c) the positive false discovery rate of Storey (2002), which has a Bayesian motivation. We also introduce our recently developed fast algorithm for implementing the minP adjustment to control family- wise error rate. Adjusted p-values for different approaches are applied to gene expression data from two recently published microarray studies. The properties of these procedures for multiple testing are compared.},

abstract = {The immunogenic and antigenic determinants of a synthetic peptide and the corresponding antigenic determinants in the parent protein have been elucidated. Four determinants have been defined by reactivity of a large panel of antipeptide monoclonal antibodies with short, overlapping peptides (7-28 amino acids), the immunizing peptide (36 amino acids), and the intact parent protein (the influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA). The majority of the antipeptide antibodies that also react strongly with the intact protein recognize one specific nine amino acid sequence. This immunodominant peptide determinant is located in the subunit interface in the HA trimeric structure. The relative inaccessibility of this site implies that antibody binding to the protein is to a more unfolded HA conformation. This antigenic determinant differs from those previously described for the hemagglutinin and clearly demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides to generate antibodies that interact with regions of the protein not immunogenic or generally accessible when the protein is the immunogen. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Complexes of pentacyanoferrate(III) and biologically relevant ligands, such as pyridine, pyrazole, imidazole, histidine, and other aza- and thia-heterocycles, were synthesized. Their spectral, electrochemical properties, electron exchange constants, electronic structure parameters, and reactivity with glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger were determined. The formation of the complexes following ammonia replacement by the ligands was associated with the appearance of a new band of absorbance in the visible spectrum. The constants of the complexes formation calculated at a ligand-pentacyanoferrate(III) concentrations ratio of 10:1, were 7.5 x 10(-5), 7.7 x 10(-5), and 1.8 x 10(-3) s(-1) for benzotriazole, benzimidazole, and aminothiazole ligands, respectively. The complexes showed quasi-reversible redox conversion at a glassy carbon electrode. The redox potential of the complexes spanned the potential range from 70 to 240 mV vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at pH7.2. For most of the complexes self-exchange constants (k(11)) were similar to or larger than that of hexacyanoferrate(III) (ferricyanide). The complexes containing pyridine derivatives and thia-heterocyclic ligands held a lower value of k(11) than that of ferricyanide. All complexes reacted with reduced glucose oxidase at pH7.2. The reactivity of the complex containing pyrazole was the largest in comparison to the rest of the complexes. Correlations between the complexes' reactivity and both the free energy of reaction and k(11) shows that the reactivity of pentacyanoferrates obeys the principles of Marcus's electron transfer theory. The obtained data suggest that large negative charges of the complexes decrease their reactivity.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the technical importance, performance, techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of the biosensors in general and of the electrochemical biosensors in particular. A product of reaction diffuses to the transducer in the first generation biosensors (based on Clark biosensors). The mediated biosensors or second generation biosensors use specific mediators between the reaction and the transducer to improve sensitivity. The second generation biosensors involve two steps: first, there is a redox reaction between enzyme and substrate that is reoxidized by the mediator, and eventually the mediator is oxidized by the electrode. No normal product or mediator diffusion is directly involved in the third generation biosensors, direct biosensors. Based on the type of transducer, current biosensors are divided into optical, mass, thermal, and electrochemical sensors. They are used in medical diagnostics, food quality controls, environmental monitoring, and other applications. These biosensors are also grouped under two broad categories of sensors: direct and indirect detection systems. Moreover, these systems could be further grouped into continuous or batch operation. Therefore, amperometric biosensors and their current applications are focused on more in detail since they are the most commonly used biosensors in monitoring and diagnosing tests in clinical analysis. Problems related to the commercialization of medical, environmental, and industrial biosensors as well as their performance characteristics, their competitiveness in comparison to the conventional analytical tools, and their costs determine the future development of these biosensors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although much is known about the natural history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the development of SLE autoantibodies before the diagnosis of the disease has not been extensively explored. We investigated the onset and progression of autoantibody development before the clinical diagnosis. METHODS The Department of Defense Serum Repository contains approximately 30 million specimens prospectively collected from more than 5 million U.S. Armed Forces personnel. We evaluated serum samples obtained from 130 persons before they received a diagnosis of SLE, along with samples from matched controls. RESULTS In 115 of the 130 patients with SLE (88 percent), at least one SLE autoantibody tested was present before the diagnosis (up to 9.4 years earlier; mean, 3.3 years). Antinuclear antibodies were present in 78 percent (at a dilution of 1:120 or more), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies in 55 percent, anti-Ro antibodies in 47 percent, anti-La antibodies in 34 percent, anti-Sm antibodies in 32 percent, anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies in 26 percent, and antiphospholipid antibodies in 18 percent. Antinuclear, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-Ro, and anti-La antibodies were present earlier than anti-Sm and anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies (a mean of 3.4 years before the diagnosis vs. 1.2 years, P=0.005). Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, with a mean onset 2.2 years before the diagnosis, were found later than antinuclear antibodies (P=0.06) and earlier than anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies (P=0.005). For many patients, the earliest available serum sample was positive; therefore, these measures of the average time from the first positive antibody test to the diagnosis are underestimates of the time from the development of antibodies to the diagnosis. Of the 130 initial matched controls, 3.8 percent were positive for one or more autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS Autoantibodies are typically present many years before the diagnosis of SLE. Furthermore, the appearance of autoantibodies in patients with SLE tends to follow a predictable course, with a progressive accumulation of specific autoantibodies before the onset of SLE, while patients are still asymptomatic.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: One important application of gene expression microarray data is classification of samples into categories, such as the type of tumor. The use of microarrays allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes expressions per sample. This ability to measure gene expression en masse has resulted in data with the number of variables p(genes) far exceeding the number of samples N. Standard statistical methodologies in classification and prediction do not work well or even at all when N {\textless} p. Modification of existing statistical methodologies or development of new methodologies is needed for the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We propose a novel analysis procedure for classifying (predicting) human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions. This procedure involves dimension reduction using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and classification using Logistic Discrimination (LD) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). We compare PLS to the well known dimension reduction method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Under many circumstances PLS proves superior; we illustrate a condition when PCA particularly fails to predict well relative to PLS. The proposed methods were applied to five different microarray data sets involving various human tumor samples: (1) normal versus ovarian tumor; (2) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) versus Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); (3) Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCLL) versus B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (BCLL); (4) normal versus colon tumor; and (5) Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Carcinoma (NSCLC) versus renal samples. Stability of classification results and methods were further assessed by re-randomization studies.},

abstract = {Medical studies often collect physiological and/or psychological measurements over time from multiple subjects, to study dynamics such as circadian rhythms. Under the assumption that the expected response functions of all subjects are the same after shift and scale transformations, shape-invariant models have been applied to analyze this kind of data. The shift and scale parameters provide efficient and interpretable data summaries, while the common shape function is usually modeled nonparametrically, to provide flexibility. However, due to the deterministic nature of the shift and scale parameters, potential correlations within a subject are ignored. Furthermore, the shape of the common function may depend on other factors, such as disease. In this article, we propose shape-invariant mixed effects models. A second-stage model with fixed and random effects is used to model individual shift and scale parameters. A second-stage smoothing spline ANOVA model is used to study potential covariate effects on the common shape function. We apply our methods to a real data set to investigate disease effects on circadian rhythms of cortisol, a hormone that is affected by stress. We find that patients with Cushing's syndrome lost circadian rhythms and their 24-hour means were elevated to very high levels. Patients with major depression had the same circadian shape and phases as normal subjects. However, their 24-hour mean levels were elevated and amplitudes were dampened for some patients.},

Unlike venipuncture, saliva collection (by brushing the teeth and rubbing the gums) is painless, non-invasive, inexpensive, simple and rapid. By using sensitive immunoassays in salivary specimens it is possible to diagnose immunoglobulins against a wide range of infectious diseases e.g. hepatitis A, B and C, measles, mumps, rubella, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B 19, human herpesvirus 6 and Helicobacter pylori infections. Salivary antibody testing may provide better access to epidemic outbreaks, children, large populations, hard-to-reach risk groups and may thus play a major role in the surveillance and control of infectious diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 34.) On the basis of several research studies and existing public health practices in the United Kingdom, we can conclude that saliva is a body fluid containing antibodies of diagnostic significance, which can be collected readily and cheaply, with miminal hazards.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between warfarin dosage, international normalized ratio, plasma and oral fluid concentrations of warfarin, and its metabolites, namely RR/SS- and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols. Nine patients on long-term warfarin therapy (4 with stable and 5 with unstable international normalized ratio values) were longitudinally monitored for over two months by recording warfarin dosage and measuring international normalized ratio, warfarin and warfarin alcohols concentrations in oral fluid and in plasma. At equivalent dose (20–30 mg week− 1), the international normalized ratio was in the range 2.0–2.5 and 1.5–3.1 for stable and unstable patients, respectively. Moreover, stable patients showed nearly double total and unbound plasma warfarin concentration, and nearly triple oral fluid warfarin concentrations compared to unstable patients. Correlations between warfarin dosage and total plasma concentration of warfarin (r = 0.65, p {\textless} 0.01) or RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.01), as well as between stimulated oral fluid and total plasma concentrations of warfarin (r = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.01) and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r = 0.95, p {\textless} 0.01) suggest that the relative changes of the oral fluid concentrations of these species may provide clinically useful information for monitoring individual patients. Follow-up data revealed that even in the absence of changes of warfarin dose, the oscillations of plasma and oral fluid of WAR and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols parallel oscillations of international normalized ratio. Due to the long delay of its biological action, monitoring the plasma concentration of warfarin might help to predict variations of international normalized ratio and prevent the risk of thrombotic or haemorrhagic events. The information collected suggests that non-invasive monitoring of warfarin in oral fluid might represent a suitable tool for this purpose.},

It has been shown in our laboratory that the efficiency of antigen extraction from vaccines formulated on Alhydrogel decreased significantly with increased storage time. To increase antigen extraction efficiency, the present study determined the effect of surfactants on antigen recovery from vaccine formulations. The Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) formulated on Alhydrogel and stored at 2-8°C for 3 years was used as a model in this study. The AMA1 on Alhydrogel was extracted in the presence or absence of 30. mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or 20. mM cetylpyridinium chloride in the extraction buffer (0.60. M citrate, 0.55. M phosphate, pH 8.5) using our standard antigen extraction protocols. Extracted AMA1 antigen was analyzed by 4-20{\%} Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or western blotting. The results showed that inclusion of SDS or cetylpyridinium chloride in extraction buffer increased the antigen recovery dramatically and can be used for efficient characterization of Alhydrogel vaccines. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Several strategies were performed in order to study the adjuvant effect of the LPS either encapsulated or coating the nanoparticles. OVA, as well as LPS, was incorporated either during the manufacturing process (OVA-encapsulated or LPS-encapsulated nanoparticles, respectively) or after the preparation (OVA-coated or LPS-coated nanoparticles, respectively). After the administration of 10 microg of OVA incorporated in the different formulations, all the nanoparticles, with or without LPS, were capable of amplifying the immune response (IgG(1) and IgG(2a)). However, in a model of sensitized mice to OVA, the formulation with OVA and LPS-entrapped inside the nanoparticles administered intradermally in three doses of 3 microg of OVA each was the only treatment that totally protected the mice from death after a challenge with an intraperitoneal injection of OVA. In contrast, the control group administered with OVA adsorbed onto a commercial alhydrogel adjuvant showed 80{\%} mortality. These results are highly suggestive for the valuable use of Gantrez nanoparticles combined with rough LPS of B. ovis in immunotherapy.},

At the same time, the tumour phenotype determines the nature of the tumour vasculature. Much research is now devoted to determining the impact of angiogenesis on tumour development and progression, and the reciprocal influences of tumour products on the microvasculature. A more detailed understanding of the complex parameters that govern the interactions between the tumour and vascular compartments will help to improve anti-angiogenic strategies-- not only for cancer treatment, but also for preventing recurrence.},

abstract = {The microfabrication of electrochemical immunosensors for the simultaneous detection of two protein analytes is described. The sensors consisted of two iridium oxide electrodes (1-mm diameter) patterned on a glass substrate. Capture antibodies were immobilized on the porous iridium oxide electrodes by covalent attachment using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. The spatial separation of the electrodes (2.5 mm) enabled simultaneous electrochemical immunoassays to be conducted without cross-talk between the electrodes. Proteins were measured using electrochemical ELISA, and detection was achieved by electrochemically oxidizing alkaline phosphatase-generated hydroquinone. Sensors for the simultaneous detection of goat IgG and mouse IgG, and for the tumor markers CEA and AFP, were developed. The sensors had detection limits of 1, 2, 1.2, and 1 ng/mL for goat IgG, mouse IgG, CEA, and AFP, respectively.},

@article{Hornung2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND In the context of high-throughput molecular data analysis it is common that the observations included in a dataset form distinct groups; for example, measured at different times, under different conditions or even in different labs. These groups are generally denoted as batches. Systematic differences between these batches not attributable to the biological signal of interest are denoted as batch effects. If ignored when conducting analyses on the combined data, batch effects can lead to distortions in the results. In this paper we present FAbatch, a general, model-based method for correcting for such batch effects in the case of an analysis involving a binary target variable. It is a combination of two commonly used approaches: location-and-scale adjustment and data cleaning by adjustment for distortions due to latent factors. We compare FAbatch extensively to the most commonly applied competitors on the basis of several performance metrics. FAbatch can also be used in the context of prediction modelling to eliminate batch effects from new test data. This important application is illustrated using real and simulated data. We implemented FAbatch and various other functionalities in the R package bapred available online from CRAN. RESULTS FAbatch is seen to be competitive in many cases and above average in others. In our analyses, the only cases where it failed to adequately preserve the biological signal were when there were extremely outlying batches and when the batch effects were very weak compared to the biological signal. CONCLUSIONS As seen in this paper batch effect structures found in real datasets are diverse. Current batch effect adjustment methods are often either too simplistic or make restrictive assumptions, which can be violated in real datasets. Due to the generality of its underlying model and its ability to perform well FAbatch represents a reliable tool for batch effect adjustment for most situations found in practice.},

abstract = {Efforts have been made in the last decade towards the complete characterization of saliva proteome using gel-based and gel-free approaches. The combination of these strategies resulted in the increment of the dynamic range of saliva proteome, which yield in the identification of more than 3,000 different protein species. Comparative protein profiling using isotope labeling and label free approaches has been used for the identification of novel biomarkers for oral and related diseases. Although progresses have been made in saliva proteome characterization, the comparative profiling in different pathophysiological conditions is still at the beginning if compared to other bodily fluids. The potential biomarkers identified so far lack specificity once common differentially expressed proteins were detected in the saliva of patients with distinct diseases. In addition, recent research works focused on saliva peptidome profiling already allowed a better understanding of peptides' physiological role in oral cavity. This review provides an overview of the major achievements in saliva proteomics giving emphasis to methodological concerns related with saliva collection, treatment and analysis, as well as the main advantages and pitfalls underlying salivary proteomic strategies and potential clinical outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract = {The direct electrochemistry of redox proteins has been achieved at a variety of electrodes, including modified gold, pyrolytic graphite and metal oxides. Careful design of electrode surfaces and electrolyte conditions are required for the attainment of rapid and reversible protein-electrode interaction. The electron transfer reactions of more complex systems, such as redox enzymes, are now being examined. The 'well-behaved' electrochemistry of redox proteins can be usefully exploited by coupling the electrode reaction to enzymes for which the redox proteins act as cofactors. In systems where direct electron transfer is very slow, small electron carriers, or mediators, may be employed to enhance the rate of electron exchange with the electrode. The organometallic compound ferrocene and its derivatives have proved particularly effective in this role. A new generation of electrochemical biosensors employs ferrocene derivatives as mediators.},

Initially, tumour-associated antigens were studied by examining a few proteins at a time using techniques such as 1-D SDS-PAGE and sandwich ELISAs. Now, however, with the development of high-throughput strategies, multiple potential antigens in a single experiment could be uncovered. The prevailing view is that these antigens can be used as biosensors for cancers. In addition, some of these antigens may indeed be used as targets for immunotherapy. SEREX, SERPA, and protein microarray technology have been the three dominant strategies employed to identify tumour-associated antigens. In this mini-review, we aim to describe these three techniques and provide their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we aim to address some of the challenges of cancer immunomics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cancer nanotherapeutics are rapidly progressing and are being implemented to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems such as nonspecific biodistribution and targeting, lack of water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, and low therapeutic indices. To improve the biodistribution of cancer drugs, nanoparticles have been designed for optimal size and surface characteristics to increase their circulation time in the bloodstream. They are also able to carry their loaded active drugs to cancer cells by selectively using the unique pathophysiology of tumors, such as their enhanced permeability and retention effect and the tumor microenvironment. In addition to this passive targeting mechanism, active targeting strategies using ligands or antibodies directed against selected tumor targets amplify the specificity of these therapeutic nanoparticles. Drug resistance, another obstacle that impedes the efficacy of both molecularly targeted and conventional chemotherapeutic agents, might also be overcome, or at least reduced, using nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have the ability to accumulate in cells without being recognized by P-glycoprotein, one of the main mediators of multidrug resistance, resulting in the increased intracellular concentration of drugs. Multifunctional and multiplex nanoparticles are now being actively investigated and are on the horizon as the next generation of nanoparticles, facilitating personalized and tailored cancer treatment.},

@article{Kragh-Hansen1998,
abstract = {The present study explores intermediate stages in detergent solubilization of liposomes and Ca2+-ATPase membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and medium-sized ( approximately C12) nonionic detergents. In all cases detergent partitioning in the membranes precedes cooperative binding and solubilization, which is facilitated by exposure to detergent micelles. Nonionic detergents predominantly interact with the lipid component of Ca2+-ATPase membranes below the CMC (critical micellar concentration), whereas SDS extracts Ca2+-ATPase before solubilization of lipid. At the transition to cooperative binding, n-dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8), Triton X-100, and dodecyldimethylamine oxide induce fusion of small unilamellar liposomes to larger vesicles before solubilization. Solubilization of Ca2+-ATPase membranes is accompanied by membrane fragmentation and aggregation rather than vesicle fusion. Detergents with strongly hydrophilic heads (SDS and beta-D-dodecylmaltoside) only very slowly solubilize liposomal membranes and do not cause liposome fusion. These properties are correlated with a slow bilayer flip-flop. Our data suggest that detergent solubilization proceeds by a combination of 1) a transbilayer attack, following flip-flop of detergent molecules across the lipid bilayer, and 2) extraction of membrane components directly by detergent micelles. The present study should help in the design of efficient solubilization protocols, accomplishing the often delicate balance between preserving functional properties of detergent sensitive membrane proteins and minimizing secondary aggregation and lipid content.},

abstract = {Presence of outliers in chemical data affects all least squares models, which are extensively used in chemometrics for data exploration and modeling. Therefore, more and more attention is paid to the so-called robust models and robust statistics that aim to construct models and estimates describing well data majority. Moreover, construction of robust models allows identifying outlying observations. The outliers identification is not only essential for a proper modeling but also for understanding the reasons for unique character of the outlying sample. In this paper some basic concepts of robust techniques are presented and their usefulness in chemometric data analysis is stressed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Wang, Ke, and Brown (2003, Biometrics59, 804-812) developed a smoothing-based approach for modeling circadian rhythms with random effects. Their approach is flexible in that fixed and random covariates can affect both the amplitude and phase shift of a nonparametrically smoothed periodic function. In motivating their approach, Wang et al. stated that a simple sinusoidal function is too restrictive. In addition, they stated that "although adding harmonics can improve the fit, it is difficult to decide how many harmonics to include in the model, and the results are difficult to interpret." We disagree with the notion that harmonic models cannot be a useful tool in modeling longitudinal circadian rhythm data. In this note, we show how nonlinear mixed models with harmonic terms allow for a simple and flexible alternative to Wang et al.'s approach. We show how to choose the number of harmonics using penalized likelihood to flexibly model circadian rhythms and to estimate the effect of covariates on the rhythms. We fit harmonic models to the cortisol circadian rhythm data presented by Wang et al. to illustrate our approach. Furthermore, we evaluate the properties of our procedure with a small simulation study. The proposed parametric approach provides an alternative to Wang et al.'s semiparametric approach and has the added advantage of being easy to implement in most statistical software packages.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties which make them promising platforms for drug delivery. However, immune cells in the bloodstream (such as monocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and dendritic cells) and in tissues (such as resident phagocytes) have a propensity to engulf and eliminate certain nanoparticles. A nanoparticle's interaction with plasma proteins (opsonins) and blood components (via hemolysis, thrombogenicity and complement activation) may influence uptake and clearance and hence potentially affect distribution and delivery to the intended target sites. Nanoparticle uptake by the immune cells is influenced by many factors. Different nanoparticles have been shown to act on different pathways, while various characteristics/properties also affect which pathway is employed for particle internalization. Nanoparticle protein binding occurs almost instantaneously once the particle enters biological medium, and the physical properties of such a particle-protein complex are often different than those of the formulated particle. These new properties can contribute to different biological responses and change nanoparticle biodistribution. Therefore, in the situation when specific delivery to immune cells is not desired, the ideal nanoparticle platform is the one whose integrity is not disturbed in the complex biological environment, which provides extended circulation in the blood to maximize delivery to the target site, is not toxic to blood cellular components, and is "invisible" to the immune cells which can remove it from circulation. This review discusses the most recent data on nanoparticle interactions with blood components and how particle size and surface charge define their hematocompatibility. This includes properties which determine particle interaction with plasma proteins and uptake by macrophages. We will also provide an overview of in vitro methods useful in identifying interactions with components of the immune system and the potential effects of such interaction on particle distribution to tissues.},

abstract = {Ultrafine particles and engineered nanoparticles have unique aerodynamic and biochemical properties that affect the immune system and human health in ways that are different from or exceed those seen with gases or larger particulates. These effects result from a unique set of physical characteristics and surface moieties, which generate an ability of UFPs to enter tissues and cells, interact with proteins and DNA at a molecular level and directly and indirectly modulate the immune system by novel mechanisms. In recent years, a new field known as nanotechnology has impacted multiple industries by taking advantage of the special qualities of these small "atomic-sized" particles. Nanomedicine has already opened up a new avenue of research in cancer therapy, drug delivery and immune regulation. While the benefits of this new science to human civilization are seemingly immeasurable, it is also important to appreciate that these particles can also lead to harmful effects on human health. In vitro and animal studies are showing that nanoparticles and UFPs are capable of activating proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, with recruitment of inflammatory cells including basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. These changes may have an impact on immune defense, but also on the Th1/Th2 balance, and even on non-immunologic function. Resulting immune system derangement can lead to increases in incidence of autoimmune, allergic and even neoplastic diseases. Cardiorespiratory effects have been observed to occur in humans. Much further research is needed to establish safe exposure levels for this important new class of particulates.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

The protein mass adsorbed to the particles was assessed by BCA protein assay, the protein adsorption patterns were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Considerable differences in the protein adsorption with regard to preferential adsorbed proteins were detectable for the different functional groups. Possible correlations between the surface characteristics and the protein adsorption are shown and discussed. The knowledge concerning the interactions of proteins and nanoparticles can be used for a rational development of particulate drug carriers and can also be useful for an optimized design of medical devices, e.g., hemodialysis membranes or implants.},

DWD has proven to be very useful for several fundamental bioinformatics tasks, including classification, data visualization and removal of biases, such as batch effects. Earlier DWD implementations, however, relied on Matlab, which is not free and requires a license. The major contribution of the R/DWD package is an implementation that is completely in R and thus can be used without any requirements for licensing or software purchase. In addition, R/DWD also provides efficient solvers for second-order-cone-programming and quadratic programming.

Furthermore, the technology enables individual DNA molecules to be rejected on demand by reversing the voltage across specific channels. In theory, combining these features enables selection of individual DNA molecules for sequencing from a pool, an approach called ‘Read Until'. Here we apply dynamic time warping to match short query current traces to references, demonstrating selection of specific regions of small genomes, individual amplicons from a group of targets, or normalisation of amplicons in a set. This is the first demonstration of direct selection of specific DNA molecules in real time whilst sequencing on any device and enables many novel uses for the MinION.},

abstract = {When added to protein solutions, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) creates an effective attraction between protein molecules due to depletion forces. This effect has been widely used to crystallize proteins, and PEG is among the most successful crystallization agents in current use. However, PEG is almost always used in combination with a salt at either low or relatively high concentrations. Here the effects of sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate concentration on PEG 8000/ovalbumin liquid-liquid (L-L) phase separation are investigated. At low salt the L-L phase separation occurs at decreasing protein concentration with increasing salt concentration, presumably due to repulsive electrostatic interactions between proteins. At high salt concentration, the behavior depends on the nature of the salt. Sodium chloride has little effect on the L-L phase separation, but ammonium sulfate decreases the protein concentration at which the L-L phase separation occurs. This trend is attributed to the effects of critical fluctuations on depletion forces. The implications of these results for designing solution conditions optimal for protein crystallization are discussed.},

abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that in vivo administration of murine interleukin 12 (IL-12) to mice results in augmentation of cytotoxic natural killer (NK)/lymphocyte-activated killer cell activity, enhancement of cytolytic T cell generation, and induction of interferon gamma secretion. In this study, the in vivo activity of murine IL-12 against a number of murine tumors has been evaluated. Experimental pulmonary metastases or subcutaneous growth of the B16F10 melanoma were markedly reduced in mice treated intraperitoneally with IL-12, resulting in an increase in survival time. The therapeutic effectiveness of IL-12 was dose dependent and treatment of subcutaneous tumors could be initiated up to 14 d after injection of tumor cells. Likewise, established experimental hepatic metastases and established subcutaneous M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma and Renca renal cell adenocarcinoma tumors were effectively treated by IL-12 at doses which resulted in no gross toxicity. Local peritumoral injection of IL-12 into established subcutaneous Renca tumors resulted in regression and complete disappearance of these tumors. IL-12 was as effective in NK cell-deficient beige mice or in mice depleted of NK cell activity by treatment with antiasialo GM1, suggesting that NK cells are not the primary cell type mediating the antitumor effects of this cytokine. However, the efficacy of IL-12 was greatly reduced in nude mice suggesting the involvement of T cells. Furthermore, depletion of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells significantly reduced the efficacy of IL-12. These results demonstrate that IL-12 has potent in vivo antitumor and antimetastatic effects against murine tumors and demonstrate as well the critical role of CD8+ T cells in mediating the antitumor effects against subcutaneous tumors. },

There are three prerequisites necessary to reach this goal: 1. A non-invasive method for collecting biological samples. 2. Specific biomarkers associated with health or disease. 3. A technology platform to rapidly discriminate the biomarkers. An initiative catalysed by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) has created a roadmap to achieve this goal through the use of oral fluids as the diagnostic medium to scrutinize the health and disease status. This is an ideal opportunity to bridge state-of-the-art saliva-based biosensors and disease-discriminatory salivary biomarkers in diagnostic applications. Oral fluid, often called the mirror of the body, is a perfect medium to be explored for health and disease surveillance. The translational applications and opportunities are enormous. This review presents the translational value of saliva as a credible clinical diagnostic fluid and the scientific rationale for such use.},

abstract = {Aicda is crucial for antibody diversification by mediating Ig class-switch recombination, V(D)J hypermutation (SHM) and, in some species, gene conversion. Recently, evidence has accumulated to show that Aicda is expressed during B-cell development and that this expression in some unknown way, mediates tolerance in immature and transitional B cells. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Umiker et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3093-3108] show that enforced expression of Aicda during early B-cell development is associated with self-tolerance. Curiously, constitutive Aicda expression that begins early in B cells suppresses the generation of autoreactive IgM but promotes the expression of self-reactive IgG. In contrast, when Aicda is activated later in B-cell development, self-reactive IgM is abundant but IgG is not. These observations suggest pathways for self-tolerance that have been little explored.},

abstract = {We developed a new platform at the interface of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and electroactive polymers (EAPs) by combining the easy buildup of PEM thin films and the deformation characteristics of the EAPs. The PEM films were made of poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). After [Fe(CN)6]4- ions (FCIV) were added, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed, resulting in a reversible expansion and contraction of the film. The shape change as well as the film buildup prior to the cycling were monitored in situ using the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EC-QCM-D). Electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) images confirmed the rapid shape deformation. The process takes place in an aqueous environment under mild conditions (maximum potential of 600 mV and no pH change), which makes it a promising tool for biomedical applications. In addition, the electrochemically active films are produced using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method that is already established in biotechnology and biomaterials science; therefore, the presented approach can be readily adapted in these areas, bringing about a new possibility for the nanoscale dynamic control of coating thickness in various applications.},

We find that the system provides weak protection against adaptive adversaries: It is possible to conceal knives, guns, and explosives from detection by exploiting properties of the device's backscatter X-ray technology. We also investigate cyberphysical threats and propose novel attacks that use malicious software and hardware to compromise the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the device. Overall, our findings paint a mixed picture of the Secure 1000 that carries lessons for the design, evaluation, and operation of advanced imaging technologies, for the ongoing public debate concerning their use, and for cyberphysical security more broadly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns are often raised about the accuracy of microarray technologies and the degree of cross-platform agreement, but there are yet no methods which can unambiguously evaluate precision and sensitivity for these technologies on a whole-array basis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A methodology is described for evaluating the precision and sensitivity of whole-genome gene expression technologies such as microarrays. The method consists of an easy-to-construct titration series of RNA samples and an associated statistical analysis using non-linear regression. The method evaluates the precision and responsiveness of each microarray platform on a whole-array basis, i.e., using all the probes, without the need to match probes across platforms. An experiment is conducted to assess and compare four widely used microarray platforms. All four platforms are shown to have satisfactory precision but the commercial platforms are superior for resolving differential expression for genes at lower expression levels. The effective precision of the two-color platforms is improved by allowing for probe-specific dye-effects in the statistical model. The methodology is used to compare three data extraction algorithms for the Affymetrix platforms, demonstrating poor performance for the commonly used proprietary algorithm relative to the other algorithms. For probes which can be matched across platforms, the cross-platform variability is decomposed into within-platform and between-platform components, showing that platform disagreement is almost entirely systematic rather than due to measurement variability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results demonstrate good precision and sensitivity for all the platforms, but highlight the need for improved probe annotation. They quantify the extent to which cross-platform measures can be expected to be less accurate than within-platform comparisons for predicting disease progression or outcome.},

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of salivary antidesmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3 ELISA in the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients with that of serum desmogleins ELISA. Methods. Eighty-six untreated PV patients and 180 age-and sex-matched PV-free controls were recruited in this case-control study. PV was diagnosed based on clinical, histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence findings. After processing, serum and salivary anti-Dsg 1 and 3 were measured by the ELISA method using Euroimmun kit (L{\"{u}}beck, Germany). Results. Using the cut-off point of 20 relative units (RU)/mL, the serum anti-Dsg 1 and 3 ELISA were positive in 62 (72.1{\%}) and 83 (96.5{\%}) patients, respectively, and the salivary anti-Dsg 1 and 3 ELISA were positive in 31 (36.1{\%}) and 63 (73.3{\%}) patients, respectively. The specificity of salivary anti-Dsg 1 and anti-Dsg 3 were both 98.9{\%}. Optimal cut-off values of 7.7 and 13.4 RU/mL were determined for the salivary anti-Dsg 1 and anti-Dsg 3 ELISA, respectively. Conclusion. Salivary anti-Dsg 1 and 3 ELISA with high specificities (98.9{\%}) could be suggested as safe and noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of PV when obtaining a blood sample is difficult.},

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.},

In this paper we have utilized a Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to detect dissipative losses induced by the attachment of intact vesicles. We modified a sandwich assay by coupling the secondary antibodies to vesicles. This resulted in an increase of detection sensitivity, achieving a diagnostically relevant detection limit of 5 ng/ml or 30 pM antigens. In addition, we could combine the individual assay steps to decrease the total time to result in about 30 minutes.},

The clear benefits of using nanosized products in various biological and medical applications are often challenged by concerns about the lack of adequate data regarding their toxicity.

Nanoparticles can be engineered to either avoid immune system recognition or specifically inhibit or enhance the immune responses. We review herein reported observations on nanoparticle-mediated immunostimulation and immunosuppression, focusing on possible theories regarding how manipulation of particle physicochemical properties can influence their interaction with immune cells to attain desirable immunomodulation and avoid undesirable immunotoxicity.},

@article{Voest1995,
abstract = {Background: In previous animal studies, interleukin 12 (IL 12) was shown to inhibit the growth of a wide spectrum of tumors in vivo but to have no direct effect on tumor cells in vitro. Also, contrary to the expectation of a T-cell-mediated effect, the antitumor activity of IL 12 was not completely abrogated in tests of T-cell-deficient mice. These observations suggest that IL 12 may possess antiangiogenic properties that account for its tumor-inhibitory effects in vivo. Purpose: Our goal was to investigate the hypothesis that IL 12 has antiangiogenic properties. Methods: A model of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced corneal neovascularization in mice was used to evaluate the effects of IL 12 and interferon gamma (IFN $\gamma$) on angiogenesis in vivo. Different strains of male mice, e.g., immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice, natural killer cell-deficient beige mice, and T-cell-deficient nude mice, were treated with IL 12 (1 $\mu$g/day) intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days. The extent of neovascularization in response to a basic fibroblast growth factor pellet and the inhibition of neovascularization by IL 12 or IFN $\gamma$ were assessed by measuring the maximal vessel length and the corneal circumference involved in new blood vessel formation. The antitumor activities of IL 12 and of the angiogenesis inhibitor AGM-1470 were evaluated in Lewis lung carcinomabearing mice. In vitro proliferation studies were performed on bovine capillary endothelial cells, mouse pancreatic islet endothelial cells, and mouse hemangioendothelioma cells. Results: IL 12 treatment almost completely inhibited corneal neovascularization in C57BL/6, SCID, and beige mice. This potent suppression of angiogenesis was prevented by the administration of IFN $\gamma$-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the suppression was mediated through IFN $\gamma$. In addition, the administration of IFN $\gamma$ reproduced the antiangiogenic effects observed during treatment with IL 12. Treatment with IL 12 and AGM-1470 combined did not increase toxicity and showed a trend toward enhanced antitumor efficacy in Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice. Conclusions: IL 12 strongly inhibits neovascularization. This effect is not mediated by a specific cell type of the immune system. Instead, IL 12 has been shown to induce IFN $\gamma$, which, in turn, appears to play a critical role as a mediator of the antiangiogenic effects of IL 12. Implications: Recognition of the mechanisms of the antiangiogenic properties of IL 12 may be crucial in planning its clinical applications, including a possibility of coadministration with other inhibitors of neovascularization.

abstract = {AIM: To clarify the specific roles and mechanisms of long interspersed nuclear element-1 ORF-1 protein [human long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), ORF-1p] in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and cell proliferation regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.

METHODS: MTT assays were performed to identify the effect of the chemotherapeutic drug toxicity on HepG2 cells. Cell proliferation inhibition and the IC50 were calculated by the Origin 8.0 software. Western blotting assays were performed to investigate whether LINE-1 ORF-1p modulates the expression of some important genes, including p53, p27, p15, Bcl-2, mdr, and p-gp. To corroborate the proliferation and anchor-independent growth results, the HepG2 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to investigate the effect of LINE-1 ORF-1p on the apoptosis regulation.

RESULTS: LINE-1 ORF-1p contributed to the resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin and epirubicin) in HepG2 cells. The IC50 of the epirubicin and cisplatin increased from 36.04 nmol/L to 59.11 nmol/L or from 37.94 nmol/L to 119.32 nmol/L. Repression of LINE-1 ORF-1p expression by the siRNA could markedly enhance the response of HepG2 cells to the epirubicin and cisplatin. The IC50 correspondingly decreased from 28.06 nmol/L to 3.83 nmol/L or from 32.04 nmol/L to 2.89 nmol/L. Interestingly, down-regulation of LINE-1 ORF-1p level by siRNA could promote the response of HepG2 cells to the paclitaxel. The IC50 decreased from 35.90 nmol/L to 7.36 nmol/L. However, overexpression of LINE-1 ORF-1p did not modulate the paclitaxel toxicity in HepG2 cells. Further Western blotting revealed that LINE-1 ORF-1p enhanced mdr and p-gp gene expression. As a protein arrested in the nucleus, LINE-1 ORF-1p may function through modulating transcriptional activity of some important transcription factors. Indeed, LINE-1 ORF-1p promoted HepG2 cell proliferation, anchor-independent growth and protected the cells against apoptosis through modulating the expression of p15, p21, p53, and Bcl-2 genes.

CONCLUSION: LINE-1 ORF-1p promotes HepG2 cell proliferation and plays an important role in the resistance of chemotherapeutic drugs. By establishing novel roles and defining the mechanisms of LINE-1 ORF-1p in HCC chemotherapeutic drug resistance and cell proliferation regulation, this study indicates that LINE-1 ORF-1p is a potential target for overcoming HCC chemotherapeutic resistance.},

abstract = {The ability of therapeutic vaccines to generate large numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes that have specificity for HIV-1 or other virally infected cells has enormous potential clinical value. However, approaches to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vivo via vaccine technology have thus far been disappointing and the ex vivo production of cells for adoptive transfer is labor intensive and expensive. We describe the results of a 2-step antibody-targeting system for the production of CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for HIV-1 and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), suitable for use in vivo. In 8 consecutive human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)-positive HIV-1-infected individuals with Kaposi sarcoma, 2 cycles of this system resulted in more than 1 Log increases of specific anti-HIV and anti-KSHV CD8+ lymphocytes. These expanded cells have an effector phenotype that includes the ability to produce interferon-gamma and CD45Ra+/CD69+ staining. We have shown that antibody-targeted B cells can function as effective antigen-presenting molecules and lead to sustained specific T-lymphocyte expansion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of immunosuppressed individuals. This approach, which offers an easy and effective protocol for the amplification of specific antiviral and antitumor CTLs, may offer significant advances for in vivo T-cell immunotherapeutic protocols.},

abstract = {To explore the potential of tumor-specific DNA as a biomarker for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), we queried DNA from saliva or plasma of 93 HNSCC patients. We searched for somatic mutations or human papillomavirus genes, collectively referred to as tumor DNA. When both plasma and saliva were tested, tumor DNA was detected in 96{\%} of 47 patients. The fractions of patients with detectable tumor DNA in early- and late-stage disease were 100{\%} (n = 10) and 95{\%} (n = 37), respectively. When segregated by site, tumor DNA was detected in 100{\%} (n = 15), 91{\%} (n = 22), 100{\%} (n = 7), and 100{\%} (n = 3) of patients with tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx, respectively. In saliva, tumor DNA was found in 100{\%} of patients with oral cavity cancers and in 47 to 70{\%} of patients with cancers of the other sites. In plasma, tumor DNA was found in 80{\%} of patients with oral cavity cancers, and in 86 to 100{\%} of patients with cancers of the other sites. Thus, saliva is preferentially enriched for tumor DNA from the oral cavity, whereas plasma is preferentially enriched for tumor DNA from the other sites. Tumor DNA in saliva was found postsurgically in three patients before clinical diagnosis of recurrence, but in none of the five patients without recurrence. Tumor DNA in the saliva and plasma appears to be a potentially valuable biomarker for detection of HNSCC.},

abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

This study uses primary data collected over 2 days (Thanksgiving Eve and Thanksgiving Day 2010) at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to examine the perception of the travelling public about the new airport screening procedures. Findings suggest that majority of air travelers are worried about terrorism when they travel; they also considered their privacy would be invaded by the enhanced pat down procedures and the new full body image scanners; travelers would support profiling even if it would invade their privacy while investigating acts of terrorism and majority also supported the use of one's religion if profiling is done at the airports. The study recommended more rigorous educational campaign by TSA to address the privacy and health risk concerns of the new machines. Future research studies in view of the findings included interviewing TSA and Homeland Security officials and also studying airport security systems in Israel and other European countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org.},

abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

In addition to its oral indications, the analysis of saliva provides important information about the functioning of various organs within the body. In this respect, endocrine research certainly occupies a central role. The present review considers the laboratory aspects of salivary assays with respect to the different analytes including ions, drugs and various non-protein/protein compounds such as hormones and immunoglobulins. This review also examines the consequences of preanalytical variation with respect to collection strategy and subsequent storage conditions.

To address this apparent problem, we compared gene expression between two microarray platforms: the short oligonucleotide Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip and a spotted cDNA array using a mouse model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension. RNA extracted from treated mice was analyzed using Affymetrix and cDNA platforms and then by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for validation of specific genes. For the 11,710 genes present on both arrays, we assessed the relative impact of experimental treatment and platform on measured expression and found that biological treatment had a far greater impact on measured expression than did platform for more than 90{\%} of genes, a result validated by qRT-PCR. In the small number of cases in which platforms yielded discrepant results, qRT-PCR generally did not confirm either set of data, suggesting that sequence-specific effects may make expression predictions difficult to make using any technique.},

The commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The ability to engender immunity safely against such self-antigens would facilitate the development of novel vaccines and immunotherapies. In this article, we address the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with these elements. We used immunohistochemical analysis and literature precedent to identify potential off-target tissues in humans and establish their translatability in preclinical species to guide safety assessments. Immunization of mice with murine L1 open reading frame 2 induced strong CD8 T cell responses without detectable tissue damage. Similarly, immunization of rhesus macaques with human LINE-1 open reading frame 2 (96{\%} identity with macaque), as well as simian endogenous retrovirus-K Gag and Env, induced polyfunctional T cell responses to all Ags, and Ab responses to simian endogenous retrovirus-K Env. There were no adverse safety or pathological findings related to vaccination. These studies provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that immune responses can be induced safely against this class of self-antigens and pave the way for investigation of them as HIV- or tumor-associated targets.},

Knowledge of B-cell epitopes may be used in the design of vaccines and diagnostics tests. It is therefore of interest to develop improved methods for predicting B-cell epitopes. In this paper, we describe an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In order to do this, three data sets of linear B-cell epitope annotated proteins were constructed. A data set was collected from the literature, another data set was extracted from the AntiJen database and a data sets of epitopes in the proteins of HIV was collected from the Los Alamos HIV database. An unbiased validation of the methods was made by testing on data sets on which they were neither trained nor optimized on. We have measured the performance in a non-parametric way by constructing ROC-curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The best single method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes is the hidden Markov model. Combining the hidden Markov model with one of the best propensity scale methods, we obtained the BepiPred method. When tested on the validation data set this method performs significantly better than any of the other methods tested.

abstract = {High-throughput data generation platforms, like mass-spectrometry, microarrays, and second-generation sequencing are susceptible to batch effects due to run-to-run variation in reagents, equipment, protocols, or personnel. Currently, batch correction methods are not commonly applied to microbiome sequencing datasets. In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.},

abstract = {Although the search for disease biomarkers continues, the clinical return has thus far been disappointing. The complexity of the body's response to disease makes it difficult to represent this response with only a few biomarkers, particularly when many are present at low levels. An alternative to the typical reductionist biomarker paradigm is an assay we call an "immunosignature." This approach leverages the response of antibodies to disease-related changes, as well as the inherent signal amplification associated with antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. To perform an immunosignature assay, the antibodies in diluted blood are incubated with a microarray of thousands of random sequence peptides. The pattern of binding to these peptides is the immunosignature. Because the peptide sequences are completely random, the assay is effectively disease-agnostic, potentially providing a comprehensive diagnostic on multiple diseases simultaneously. To explore the ability of an immunosignature to detect and identify multiple diseases simultaneously, 20 samples from each of five cancer cohorts collected from multiple sites and 20 noncancer samples (120 total) were used as a training set to develop a reference immunosignature. A blinded evaluation of 120 blinded samples covering the same diseases gave 95{\%} classification accuracy. To investigate the breadth of the approach and test sensitivity to biological diversity further, immunosignatures of {\textgreater}1,500 historical samples comprising 14 different diseases were examined by training with 75{\%} of the samples and testing the remaining 25{\%}. The average accuracy was {\textgreater}98{\%}. These results demonstrate the potential power of the immunosignature approach in the accurate, simultaneous classification of disease.},

abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip R system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip R arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip R arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip R arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (P M and M M) values of these data, and examine the variancemean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the P M and M M using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multiarray average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed P M values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.

abstract = {In human cutaneous malignant melanoma, a predominance of activated mutations in the N-ras gene has been documented. To obtain a mouse model most closely mimicking the human disease, a transgenic mouse line was generated by targeting expression of dominant-active human N-ras (N-RasQ61K) to the melanocyte lineage by tyrosinase regulatory sequences (Tyr::N-RasQ61K). Transgenic mice show hyperpigmented skin and develop cutaneous metastasizing melanoma. Consistent with the tumor suppressor function of the INK4a locus that encodes p16INK4A and p19(ARF), {\textgreater}90{\%} of Tyr::N-RasQ61K INK4a-/- transgenic mice develop melanoma at 6 months. Primary melanoma tumors are melanotic, multifocal, microinvade the epidermis or epithelium of hair follicles, and disseminate as metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver. Primary melanoma can be transplanted s.c. in nude mice, and if injected i.v. into NOD/SCID mice colonize the lung. In addition, primary melanomas and metastases contain cells expressing the stem cell marker nestin suggesting a hierarchical structure of the tumors comprised of primitive nestin-expressing precursors and differentiated cells. In conclusion, a novel mouse model with melanotic and metastasizing melanoma was obtained by recapitulating genetic lesions frequently found in human melanoma.},

abstract = {Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1) belongs to a family of retrotransposons. Expression of the normally repressed L1 retrotransposons has been shown to induce genome instability by creating DNA double-stranded breaks and chromosomal rearrangements through the process of retrotransposition. At present, little is known about the expression of L1-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p which are indispensable for its retrotransposition activity. Given its potentially harmful effects on the genome, we investigated the implications of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression and their subcellular localization in a range of breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissues including 15 normal breast tissues, 25 fibroadenomas, 25 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 95 invasive cancers. Clinicopathologic parameters and survival outcomes were investigated in association with the cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p using univariate and multivariate analysis. High cytoplasmic expression of ORF1p and ORF2p was seen in DCIS tumors, but they were not related with survival outcome. The majority of invasive cancers were found to express both ORF1p and ORF2p in the cytoplasm, while nuclear expression was also seen in a subclass of those invasive cancers in the range of 28-31 {\%}. Tumors with high nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p were more significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001) and the worst patient survival (p {\textless} 0.0001) than those with cytoplasmic expression. This is the first study examining the effects of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression in breast cancer tissues. Our observation shows altered expression patterns of ORF1p and ORF2p within invasive cancers, which are related to differences in overall patient survival. The differing patterns of both cytoplasmic and nuclear ORF1p and ORF2p expression indicate that further studies of the biology and function of L1 retrotransposons are required in breast cancer.},

abstract = {We explore the framework of permutation-based p-values for assessing the performance of classi- fiers. In this paperwe study two simple permutation tests. The first test assesswhether the classifier has found a real class structure in the data; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by per- muting the labels in the data. This test has been used extensively in classification problems in computational biology. The second test studies whether the classifier is exploiting the dependency between the features in classification; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by permut- ing the features within classes, inspired by restricted randomization techniques traditionally used in statistics. This new test can serve to identify descriptive features which can be valuable infor- mation in improving the classifier performance. We study the properties of these tests and present an extensive empirical evaluation on real and synthetic data. Our analysis shows that studying the classifier performance via permutation tests is effective. In particular, the restricted permutation test clearly reveals whether the classifier exploits the interdependency between the features in the data.},

abstract = {The micromechanical properties of pure and cholesterol modified egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EggPC) vesicles prepared by sonication were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on mica surface. The force curves between an AFM tip and an unruptured vesicle were obtained by contact mode. During approach, two repulsion regions with two breaks were observed. The slopes of the two repulsive force regimes for the pure EggPC vesicles are determined to be several times lower than that of EggPC/cholesterol vesicles. The elastic properties from force plot analysis based on the Hertzian model showed that Young's modulus (E) and the bending modulus (kc) of cholesterol-modified vesicles increased several-fold compared with pure EggPC vesicles. The significant difference is attributed to the enhanced rigidity of the EggPC vesicles as a result of the incorporation of cholesterol molecules. The behavior of cholesterol-modified vesicles upon adsorption is different from that in solution as revealed by mechanical properties. The results indicate that AFM can provide a direct method to measure the mechanical properties of adsorbed small liposomes and to detect the stability change of liposomes.},

abstract = {AMPylation (adenylylation) has been recognized as an important post-translational modification that is used by pathogens to regulate host cellular proteins and their associated signaling pathways. AMPylation has potential functions in various cellular processes, and it is widely conserved across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, despite the identification of many AMPylators, relatively few candidate substrates of AMPylation are known. This is changing with the recent development of a robust and reliable method for identifying new substrates using protein microarrays, which can markedly expand the list of potential substrates. Here we describe procedures for detecting AMPylated and auto-AMPylated proteins in a sensitive, high-throughput and nonradioactive manner. The approach uses high-density protein microarrays fabricated using nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) technology, which enables the highly successful display of fresh recombinant human proteins in situ. The modification of target proteins is determined via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The assay can be accomplished within 11 h.},

In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we provide a definition of the model at the phenotypi The infinitesimal model 2 level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, ... We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. In each case, by conditioning on the pedigree relating individuals in the population, we incorporate arbitrary selection and population structure. We suppose that we can observe the pedigree up to the present generation, together with all the ancestral traits, and we show, in particular, that the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1{\{} ? M . Simulations suggest that in particular cases the convergence may be as fast as 1{\{}M .}}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Saliva has been recommended as an alternative non-invasive specimen for detection of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of the inherent disadvantages of using serum for such testing. METHODS: In a double-blind study, paired serum and saliva specimens were collected from 100 known HIV antibody seropositive and 100 seronegative individuals. The serum was tested in the conventional way while saliva was tested after modifying the routinely used serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay so as to detect antibodies to HIV from saliva. RESULTS: The sensitivity of saliva for HIV antibody detection using the modified test protocol was found to be 95{\%} by GENELAVIA MIXT ELISA and 97{\%} by DETECT-HIV ELISA, while the specificity for both was 100{\%}. Identical results were obtained even after 7 months of storage of the saliva at 4 degrees C without any preservatives. CONCLUSION: Saliva is a safe and cost-effective alternative to serum for HIV antibody detection for most surveillance purposes but not for diagnostic purposes.},

abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in R-m (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n = O(m(1/4) log(5/2)(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an l(p), ball for O {\textless} p {\textless}= 1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with l(2) error O(N1/2-1/p). It is possible to design n = O (N log (m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of l(p) balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 {\textless} p {\textless}= 1, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces.},

ILCs include Natural Killer (NK) cells, first described 38 years ago, as well as the more recently discovered lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, NK(22) cells and ILC2s. ILCs reflect many functions of CD4(+) T helper cells by expressing IFN$\gamma$, IL-17, IL-22 or IL-13. However, in contrast to T cells, they are not selected on the basis of antigen specificity, and expand and act shortly after stimulation. Therefore, ILCs play fundamental roles early in responses to infection and injury, in the maintenance of homeostasis, and possibly in the regulation of adaptive immunity. Here, we review the recent data on the development and role of ROR$\gamma$t(+) ILCs and ILC2s in intestinal homeostasis and defense.},

The polymerization process was monitored into the thick film region, where the change in frequency and dissipation with increasing film mass changes sign as predicted by the Voigt viscoelastic model. Our experimental data are compared with predictions of this model, and satisfactory agreement is found for low overtone numbers. The Voigt model was applied to analyze the measured changes in frequency, $\Delta$f, and dissipation, $\Delta$D, in order to extract information on layer thickness, shear elasticity, $\mu$, and shear viscosity, $\eta$, of the growing film. The increasing rate of changes in $\Delta$f and $\Delta$D observed after about 150s of polymerization was found to correlate with an increasing growth rate of the film thickness. For longer polymerization times a close to linear increase in thickness with time was observed. The sensitivity, defined as the derivatives of $\Delta$f and $\Delta$D with respect to thickness, depends on overtone number and is different for the frequency and dissipation signals - facts that should be considered when investigating small changes in thick films used in e.g. sensor applications.},

Adverse events, survival, and cytotoxicity against autologous tumor and tumor-associated antigens were measured. Fourteen patients were thrice vaccinated 2 weeks apart with autologous DCs pulsed with tumor lysate. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were differentiated into phenotypically and functionally confirmed DCs. Vaccination with tumor lysate-pulsed DCs was safe, and no evidence of autoimmune disease was noted. Ten patients were tested for the development of cytotoxicity through a quantitative PCR-based assay. Six of 10 patients demonstrated robust systemic cytotoxicity as demonstrated by IFN-gamma expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to tumor lysate after vaccination. Using HLA-restricted tetramer staining, we identified a significant expansion in CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clones against one or more of tumor-associated antigens MAGE-1, gp100, and HER-2 after DC vaccination in four of nine patients. A significant CD8+ T-cell infiltrate was noted intratumorally in three of six patients who underwent reoperation. The median survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme in this study (n = 8) was 133 weeks. This Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and bioactivity of an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine for patients with malignant glioma. We demonstrate for the first time the ability of an active immunotherapy strategy to generate antigen-specific cytotoxicity in brain tumor patients.},

Accordingly, saliva can reflect the physiologic state of the body, including emotional, endocrinal, nutritional and metabolic variations and acts as a source for the monitoring of oral and also systemic health. This review presents an update on the status of saliva diagnostics and delves into their applications to the discovery of biomarkers for cancer detection and therapeutic applications. Translating scientific findings of nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites in body fluids to clinical applications is a cumbersome and challenging journey. Our research group is pursuing the biology of salivary analytes and the development of technologies for detection of distinct biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity. The avenue of saliva diagnostics incorporating transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic findings will enable us to connect salivary molecular analytes to monitor therapies, therapeutic outcomes, and finally disease progression in cancer.},

abstract = {Electrodes have become more and more popular in biomedical and bioengineering applications, where they are used mostly to apply/measure potentials or currents to/from biological systems. Under such conditions, electrochemical reactions commonly occur at the electrode surface. With the aim to better describe these processes we applied constant currents using transparent indium tin oxide microelectrodes to induce a local change in pH, associated with electrolysis. The pH change was monitored optically within the first lateral 170 microm vicinity using microscopy and a pH sensitive fluorescent dye combination as indicator. The data were then fitted with a simple diffusion model. The effect of such an induced pH change was also assessed by measuring the desorption of a cationic polyelectrolyte (poly(l-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol)) as a function of the local pH. Since this polymer interacts electrostatically with surfaces in a pH dependent manner, we could show a strong effect in unbuffered solutions while buffered solutions restricted the electrochemically induced pH change below the optical resolution of the microscope. The effect of applied current on the behavior of cells was also studied on myoblasts cultured directly on the microelectrodes. We have found that current densities larger than 0.57 A m(-2) induced cell death within 2 min of exposure. Based on our model we could attribute this to the change in local pH although the effect of other electrochemically created reactive molecules could not be excluded.},

This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Deltah with the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

Here we apply bootstrapping to assess the stability of results from a cluster analysis. We illustrate the technique with a publicly available data set and draw conclusions about the reliability of clustering results in light of variation in the data. The bootstrapping procedure relies on experimental replication. We discuss the implications of replication and good design in microarray experiments.},

abstract = {This paper describes a generalised framework for doing Monte Carlo tests in multivariate linear regression.Therotation methodologyassumes multivariate normality and is a true generalisation of the classical multivariate tests - any imaginable test statistic is allowed. The generalised test statistics are dependent on the unknown covariance matrix. Rotation testing handles this problem by conditioning on sufficient statistics. Compared to permutation tests, we replace permutations by proper random rotations. Permutation tests avoid the multinormal assumption, but they are limited to relatively simple models. On the other hand, a rotation test can, in particular, be applied to any multivariate generalisation of the univariate F-test. As an important application, a detailed description of howeach single response p-value can be non- conservatively adjusted for multiplicity is given. This method is exact and non-conservative (unlike Bonferroni), and it is a generalisation of the ordinary F-test (except for the computation by simulations). Hence, this paper offers an exact Monte Carlo solution to a classical problem of multiple testing.},

abstract = {Natural tumor surveillance capabilities of the host were investigated in six different mouse tumor models where endogenous interleukin (IL)-12 does or does not dictate the efficiency of the innate immune response. Gene-targeted and lymphocyte subset–depleted mice were used to establish the relative importance of natural killer (NK) and NK1.1+ T (NKT) cells in protection from tumor initiation and metastasis. In the models examined, CD3− NK cells were responsible for tumor rejection and protection from metastasis in models where control of major histocompatibility complex class I–deficient tumors was independent of IL-12. A protective role for NKT cells was only observed when tumor rejection required endogenous IL-12 activity. In particular, T cell receptor J$\alpha$281 gene-targeted mice confirmed a critical function for NKT cells in protection from spontaneous tumors initiated by the chemical carcinogen, methylcholanthrene. This is the first description of an antitumor function for NKT cells in the absence of exogenously administered potent stimulators such as IL-12 or $\alpha$-galactosylceramide. },

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-12 has strong antitumor activity in transplantable tumor systems in the mouse. The present study was designed to determine whether tumor induction by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, can be inhibited by IL-12. BALB/cBy mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 micrograms or 100 micrograms of 3-MC and treated with 100 ng, 10 ng, or 1 ng of IL-12 for 5 days a week for 18 weeks, with a schedule of 3 weeks on and 1 week off. In mice injected with 25 micrograms of 3-MC, treatment with 100 ng of IL-12 delayed tumor appearance and reduced tumor incidence. Tumor appearance was also delayed in mice injected with 100 micrograms of 3-MC and treated with 100 ng of IL-12, but the final tumor incidence was the same as in non-IL-12-treated mice. In contrast to the characteristically round, hard, well-circumscribed, and protruding tumor induced by 3-MC, a percentage of tumors induced in IL-12-treated mice had atypical characteristics: flat, soft, and invasive. Atypical tumors had a longer latent period and were more frequently seen in mice injected with 100 micrograms of 3-MC and treated with 100 ng of IL-12. Interferon gamma, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor could be induced throughout the treatment period by IL-12, indicating that repeated injections of IL-12 do not induce a state of tachyphylaxis. High production of interferon gamma by CD8 T cells and a TH2--{\textgreater}TH1 or TH0 shift in the cytokine secretion profile of CD4 T cells were also seen in the IL-12-treated mice. IL-12 provides a powerful new way to explore the defensive role of the immune system in tumorigenesis. },

@article{Shvedova2005,
abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are new materials of emerging technological importance. As SWCNT are introduced into the life cycle of commercial products, their effects on human health and environment should be addressed. We demonstrated that pharyngeal aspiration of SWCNT elicited unusual pulmonary effects in C57BL/6 mice that combined a robust but acute inflammation with early onset yet progressive fibrosis and granulomas. A dose-dependent increase in the protein, LDH, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities in bronchoalveolar lavage were found along with accumulation of 4-hydroxynonenal (oxidative biomarker) and depletion of glutathione in lungs. An early neutrophils accumulation (day 1), followed by lymphocyte (day 3) and macrophage (day 7) influx, was accompanied by early elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta; day 1) followed by fibrogenic transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (peaked on day 7). A rapid progressive fibrosis found in mice exhibited two distinct morphologies: 1) SWCNT-induced granulomas mainly associated with hypertrophied epithelial cells surrounding SWCNT aggregates and 2) diffuse interstitial fibrosis and alveolar wall thickening likely associated with dispersed SWCNT. In vitro exposure of murine RAW 264.7 macrophages to SWCNT triggered TGF-beta1 production similarly to zymosan but generated less TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. SWCNT did not cause superoxide or NO.production, active SWCNT engulfment, or apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Functional respiratory deficiencies and decreased bacterial clearance (Listeria monocytogenes) were found in mice treated with SWCNT. Equal doses of ultrafine carbon black particles or fine crystalline silica (SiO2) did not induce granulomas or alveolar wall thickening and caused a significantly weaker pulmonary inflammation and damage.},
