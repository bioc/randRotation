abstract = {This paper describes a generalised framework for doing Monte Carlo tests in multivariate linear regression.Therotation methodologyassumes multivariate normality and is a true generalisation of the classical multivariate tests - any imaginable test statistic is allowed. The generalised test statistics are dependent on the unknown covariance matrix. Rotation testing handles this problem by conditioning on sufficient statistics. Compared to permutation tests, we replace permutations by proper random rotations. Permutation tests avoid the multinormal assumption, but they are limited to relatively simple models. On the other hand, a rotation test can, in particular, be applied to any multivariate generalisation of the univariate F-test. As an important application, a detailed description of howeach single response p-value can be non- conservatively adjusted for multiplicity is given. This method is exact and non-conservative (unlike Bonferroni), and it is a generalisation of the ordinary F-test (except for the computation by simulations). Hence, this paper offers an exact Monte Carlo solution to a classical problem of multiple testing.},

@article{Law2014,
abstract = {New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene set testing methods.},

@article{Reiner2003,
abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multi-plicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR con-trolling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the nave application of the linear step-up procedure in Ben-jamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation. Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the nave one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDR control. Availability: An R program that adjusts p-values using FDR controlling procedures is freely available over the Internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/âˆ¼ybenja.},

@article{Yekutieli1999,
abstract = {A new false discovery rate controlling procedure is proposed for multiple hypotheses testing. The procedure makes use of resampling-based p-value adjustment, and is designed to cope with correlated test statistics. Some properties of the proposed procedure are investigated theoretically, and further properties are investigated using a simulation study. According to the results of the simulation study, the new procedure offers false discovery rate control and greater power. The motivation for developing this resampling-based procedure was an actual problem in meteorology, in which almost 2000 hypotheses are tested simultaneously using highly correlated test statistics. When applied to this problem the increase in power was evident. The same procedure can be used in many other large problems of multiple testing, for example multiple endpoints. The procedure is also extended to serve as a general diagnostic tool in model selection.},
